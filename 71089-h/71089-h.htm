<h3>A PREFACE ON AUTHENTIC LIARS</h3>

<p>An authentic liar knows what he is lying about,
knows that his listeners—unless they are tenderfeet,
greenhorns—know also, and hence makes no pretense
of fooling either himself or them. At his best he is as
grave as a historian of the Roman Empire; yet what
he is after is neither credulity nor the establishment of
truth. He does not take himself too seriously, but he
does regard himself as an artist and yearns for recognition
of his art. He may lie with satiric intent; he
may lie merely to make the time pass pleasantly; he
may lie in order to take the wind out of some egotistic
fellow of his own tribe or to take in some greener;
again, without any purpose at all and directed only by
his ebullient and companion-loving nature, he may
“stretch the blanket” merely because, like the redoubtable
Tom Ochiltree, he had “rather lie on credit than
tell truth for cash.” His generous nature revolts at the
monotony of everyday facts and overflows with desire
to make his company joyful.</p>

<p>Certainly the telling of “windies” flourished in the
Old World long before America was discovered;
nevertheless the tall tale both in subject matter and in
manner of telling has been peculiar to the frontiers
of America, whether in the backwoods of the Old
South, in the mining camps of the Far West, amid
the logging camps presided over by Paul Bunyan, or
on the range lands stretching from the Gulf of Mexico
to the Canadian line. Very likely the Pilgrim Fathers
did not indulge much in the art of yarning, and the
stately Cavaliers pretty much left that sort of entertainment
to the poor—“poor but honest”—settlers. As
to whether the “decay in the art of lying” that Oscar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
Wilde observed in literary fiction has blighted that
to be heard around camp fires and on the galleries of
ranch houses, we need not here inquire. The “big uns”
that Mody Boatright has gathered together in this book
are not altogether out of the past.</p>

<p>They express a way that range folk talked and they
express also a way in which these folk cartooned
objects familiar to them like rattlesnakes, sand storms,
jack rabbits, the expanding and contracting powers of
rawhide, the suddenness of Texas northers, “killings”
according to a code that clearly distinguished a killing
from a murder, and other things. They are, in short,
authentic both as to the characters represented and the
subjects discoursed upon.</p>

<p>When in the old days two cow outfits met upon
the range, and there was “ample time,” as Andy Adams
would say, they sometimes arranged what was known
as an “auguring match.” Each outfit would pit its
prime yarn-spinner against the other and there followed
a contest not only of invention but of endurance. John
Palliser in <i>The Solitary Hunter; or, Sporting Adventures
of the Prairies</i> (London, 1856) relates how after
an all-night talking contest between a Missourian and
a Kentuckian, the umpire “at a quarter past five” found
the Kentucky man fast asleep, his opponent “sitting
up close beside him and whispering in his ear.” What
the contestants talked about, Palliser does not say,
but there is ample testimony to prove that the “auguring
matches” on the range had as precedent among the
backwoodsmen of the South who were to push out
upon the ranges a kind of round table talk in which
each talker sought to cap the tall tales of his fellow
with one a little taller.</p>

<p class="p2">For genuine artists a solitary opponent is sufficient;
art is substantive. <i>In Piney Woods Tavern; or, Sam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
Slick in Texas</i> (Philadelphia, 1858), by Samuel A.
Hammett, the narrator in traveling from the Brazos to
the Trinity rivers found the San Jacinto “a roarin’ and
a hummin’ it.... Free soil movements was a-goin’ on,
and trees a-tumblin’ in all along the banks.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I see thar war no help for it [the narrator goes on].
So I took my feet outen the stirrups, threw my saddle-bags
over my shoulder, and in me and the mar went.</p>

<p>We war in a awful tight place for a time, but we
soon landed safe. I’d jest got my critter tied out, and
a fire started to dry myself with when I see a chap
come ridin’ up the hill on a smart chunk of a pony....</p>

<p>“Hoopee! stranger”—sings out my beauty—“How
d’ye? Kept your fireworks dry, eh? How in thunder
did ye get over?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” says I, “mighty easy. Ye see, stranger, I’m
powerful on a pirogue; so I waited till I see a big log
a-driftin’ nigh the shore, when I fastened to it, set my
critter a-straddle on it, got into the saddle, paddled
over with my saddle-bags, and steered with the mare’s
tail.”</p>

<p>“Ye didn’t, though, by Ned!” says he, “did ye?”</p>

<p>“Mighty apt to”—says I—“but arter ye’ve sucked
all that in and got yer breath agin, let’s know how
<i>you</i> crossed?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” says he, settin’ his pig’s eyes on me, “I’ve
been a-riding all day with a consarned ager, and orful
dry, and afeard to drink at the prairie water holes; so
when I got to the river I jest went in fer a big drink,
swallered half a mile of water, and come over dry
shod.”</p>

<p>“Stranger,” says I, “ye’r just one huckleberry above
my persimmon. Light and take some red-eye. I thought
ye looked green, but I were barkin’ up the wrong
tree.”</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p>Story-telling in Texas was so popular that at times
it interfered with religion. The pioneer Baptist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
preacher, Z. N. Morrell, relates in his autobiographic
<i>Flowers and Fruits in the Wilderness</i> (Dallas, 1886)
that on one occasion while he was preaching in a log
cabin in East Texas his sermon was drowned by the
voices of men outside “telling anecdotes.” After an
ineffectual reprimand, the preacher finally told his
interrupters that if they would give him a chance he
would tell an anecdote and that then, if it was not
better than any of theirs, he would “take down his
sign and listen to them.” They agreed to the challenge.
The anecdote he proceeded to relate about Sam
Houston and the battle of San Jacinto won him the
right to keep on talking without interruption. The
triumph was but a repetition of David Crockett’s
election to Congress through his b’ar stories.</p>

<p>An anecdote is not by any means necessarily a
windy, but people who cultivate the art of oral narration
will sooner or later indulge in exaggerative
invention. Some candidate for the Ph.D. degree should
write a thesis on the interrelationship of the anecdote,
the tall tale, and the short story in America. What is
probably the most widely known story that the nation
has produced, “The Celebrated Jumping Frog of
Calaveras County,” is all three—and it is mostly just
a yarn in which the frontier character, Jim Smiley,
character being the essence of good anecdote, is more
important than the frog.</p>

<p>Sixty years or so ago at Covey’s college for ranch
boys, located at Concrete, Texas, near Cuero, the
“scholars” organized a liar’s club. According to the
rules of the club every boy present at a session must
tell a story. The teller of what was adjudged the best
yarn was habitually awarded as a prize a dozen hot
tamales cooked by one of the Mexican women about
the premises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span></p>

<p>One night a certain lad of few words who had been
drawn into the club was called upon to contribute.</p>

<p>“Wall,” he drawled, “I was raised away out in the
bresh up whur I never heared nobody talk, and I jes’
ain’t got no story to tell.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go on and tell something,” the other club
members urged.</p>

<p>“No,” the diffident youth remonstrated, “it ain’t no
use fer me to try to make up anything. I jest can’t
do it. I’ve been a-trying to figger up something while
you all was telling your stories, and the pump won’t
even prime.”</p>

<p>There was more urging and encouraging. But still
the boy from up the creek hung back. As a member
of the club, however, he simply had to tell something—or
“take the leggins.” Finally the leader of the group
suggested, “I guess we can let you off from lying if
you’re so much like George Washington. Just go ahead
and tell us about some interesting happening. It don’t
have to be a lie.”</p>

<p>“Wall,” the drawly tongue started off, “I’ll tell you
about something that happened to me. One morning
I was a-leaving the ranch to look out for wormy calves.
I was going to be gone all day, and jest as I throwed
my leg over the saddle, a Meskin girl that lived with
her people in a jacal close to the corral came a-running
out. ‘Here,’ says she, ‘we’ve jest been making tamales
out of the cow that got her leg broke yesterday and
you all had to kill. The meat is fat and the corn is new,
and the tamales are <i>muy sabroso</i>. You must take some
of them with you.’</p>

<p>“Now I would do nearly anything this little Meskin
girl suggested. So I told her all right, to wrop the
tamales up in some paper and a flour sack and I’d put
’em in my morral with the hank of dried beef and the
bottle of worm medicine. Which she did. Tamales ain’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
much good unless they are hot, you know, and I
figgered the wropping would keep these warm.</p>

<p>“Well, after I’d gone about six miles, I struck a bull
that I decided to rope. Which I did. The bull he kept
on going after he hit the end of the rope and my
horse he could not stop him. He dragged me about
forty miles more or less, I guess, before I hung up in
a mesquite tree with my chin between the forks of
a limb. I don’t know how long I hung there, but it was
some time. People differ as to how long it was.
Anyway, it was until the limb rotted down and
I dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to go back to the ranch afoot, and
so I hit out follering the horse’s tracks. I found him
a good piece out looking purty gant but still saddled
and the rope that had rotted off the bull’s neck still
tied to the horn of the saddle. I went right up to the
morral, for it was still on the saddle, and untied it.
I was a little gant myself. Then I felt of the sacking
around the tamales, and I couldn’t feel no heat. Says
I to myself, ‘I bet that Meskin girl didn’t wrop ’em
right and the danged things have got so cold they
won’t be no count to eat.’ But I went on and unwropped
the paper, and when I got to the shucks, danged if
they didn’t burn my fingers. Them tamales shore
tasted good after all that bull running and then hoofing
it after the horse. It is remarkable the way tamales hold
the heat when they are well wropped.”</p>

<p>Even the schools for ranch boys in Texas included
“windjamming” among their activities. But many
a frontiersman who had not had the advantage of an
education must have been forced by circumstances to
“make it strong” in telling about the Wild West
to gentle Easterners. Every new land has marvels;
hence “traveler’s tales.” When facts are taken for
fabrications, then the narrator is tempted to “cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
loose” sure enough. One of the most honest-hearted
and reliable frontiersmen that ever boiled coffee over
mesquite coals was Bigfoot Wallace. He came to Texas
from Virginia long before barbed wire “played hell”
with the longhorns. After he had himself become a
regular Longhorn he went back to his old home for
a visit. As John C. Duval in the delightful <i>Adventures
of Bigfoot Wallace</i> (1870) has the old frontiersman
describe his reception, he was egged on in the following
manner to take the bridle off and let out the last kink.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A few weeks after my arrival I went to a fandango
that was given for my special benefit. There was a
great crowd there, and everybody was anxious to see
the “Wild Texan,” as they called me. I was the lion
of the evening, particularly for the young ladies, who
never tired of asking me questions about Mexico,
Texas, the Indians, prairies, etc. I at first answered
truthfully all the questions they asked me; but when
I found they evidently doubted some of the stories I
told them which were facts, then I branched out and
gave them some whoppers. These they swallowed
down without gagging. For instance, one young woman
wanted to know how many wild horses I had ever
seen in a drove. I told her perhaps thirty or forty
thousand.</p>

<p>“Oh, now! Mr. Wallace,” said she, “don’t try to
make game of me in that way. Forty thousand horses
in one drove! Well, I declare you are a second
Munchausen!”<span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, then,” said I, “maybe you won’t believe me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>when I tell you there is a sort of spider in Texas as
big as a peck measure, the bite of which can only be
cured by music.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she answered, “I believe that’s all so,
for I have read about them in a book.”</p>

<p>“Among other whoppers, I told her there was a
varmint in Texas called the Santa Fé, that was still
worse than the tarantula, for the best brass band in
the country couldn’t cure their sting; that the creature
had a hundred legs and a sting on every one of them,
besides two large stings in its forked tail, and fangs as
big as a rattlesnake’s. When they sting you with their
legs alone, you might possibly live an hour; when
with all their stings, perhaps fifteen or twenty minutes;
but when they sting and bite you at the same
time, you first turn blue, then yellow, and then a
beautiful bottle-green, when your hair all falls out,
and your finger nails drop off, and in five minutes you
are as dead as a door nail, in spite of all the doctors in
America.”</p>

<p>“Oh! My! Mr. Wallace!” said she. “How have you
managed to live so long in that horrible country?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see,” said I, “with my tarantula boots
made of alligator skin, and my centipede hunting-shirt
made of tanned rattlesnake hides, I have escaped
pretty well; but these don’t protect you against
the stinging scorpions, cow-killers, and scaly-back
chinches, that crawl about at night when you are
asleep! The only way to keep them at a distance is
to chaw tobacco and drink whiskey, and that is the
reason the Temperance Society never flourished much
in Texas.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said she, “what a horrible country that must
be, where the people have to be stung to death, or else
chaw tobacco and drink whiskey! I don’t know which
is the worst.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “the people out there don’t seem to
mind it much; they get used to it after a while. In
fact, they seem rather to like it, for they chaw tobacco<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
and drink whiskey even in the winter time, when the
cow-killers and stinging lizards are all frozen up!”</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p class="p2">What gusto, what warmth of natural sympathy,
what genial expansion! Here the authentic liar has
been translated by circumstances and by his own genius
into the pure aura of truth. There is no distortion, no
“wrenching the true cause the wrong way,” no base
intent to win by arousing false fears or to defraud
through false hopes. The artist has but arranged the
objects of his scene and then handed the spectator
a magnifying glass that is flawlessly translucent. The
magnified vision, like that of Tartarin of Tarascon,
seems but the effect of a sunlight transilluminating all
other sunlights—the sunlight of Tartarin’s Midi
country, “the only liar in the Midi.” Only here it is the
sunlight of the West, which brings mountain ranges
a hundred miles away within apparent touching
distance and through its mirages makes antelopes stalk
as tall as giraffes, gives to buffalo bulls far out on the
prairies the proportions of hay wagons, and reveals
spired cities and tree-shadowed lakes reposing in
deserts actually so devoid of life that not even a single
blade of green grass can there be found.</p>

<p>Occasionally one of these authentic liars of the West
falls a prey to his own lying. Frank Root (<i>The Overland
Stage to California</i>) relates that one time after
a Gargantuan story-teller named Ranger Jones had
finished narrating a particularly blood-curdling “personal
experience,” a stage driver who happened to be
among the listeners looked him squarely in the eye and
said, “I hope, Ranger Jones, that you don’t expect me
to believe this story.”</p>

<p>“Well—er—no—really, I don’t,” the narrator answered.
“The fact is, I have lied out here in this Western
country so long and have been in the habit of telling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
so many damned lies, the truth of it is now that I don’t
know when I can believe myself.” In <i>Trails Plowed
Under</i> Charles M. Russell has a delicious chapter on
“Some Liars of the Old West.”</p>

<p>“These men weren’t vicious liars,” he comments. “It
was love of romance, lack of reading matter, and the
wish to be entertainin’ that makes ’em stretch facts and
invent yarns.” Among the most famous of these liars
was a man known as Lyin’ Jack, and his favorite tale
was on an elk he once killed that had a spread of
antlers fifteen feet wide. He always kept these, as he
told the story, in the loft of his cabin.</p>

<p>One time after a long absence Lyin’ Jack showed
up in Benton. “The boys” were all glad to see him
and, after a round or two of drinks, asked him for
a yarn.</p>

<p>“No, boys,” said Jack, “I’m through. For years
I’ve been tellin’ these lies—told ’em so often I got to
believin’ ’em myself. That story of mine about the
elk with the fifteen-foot horns is what cured me. I told
about that elk so often that I knowed the place I killed
it. One night I lit a candle and crawled up in the loft
to view the horns—an’ I’m damned if they weren’t
there.”</p>

<p>In a book of not enough consequence to warrant the
naming of its title, the author, writing through hearsay
and attempting to be veracious, describes the Texas
norther—which comes “sudden and soon in the dead
of night or the blaze of noon”—as being so swift in
descent, so terrible in force, and so bitterly cold that
“no old Texan would trust himself out on the prairies
in July or August with the thermometer at ninety-six
degrees, without two blankets strapped at the saddlebow
to keep him from freezing to death should a
norther blow up.” Of course no man of the range
carries his blankets on the horn of a saddle and no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
Texan ever experienced a genuine norther in July or
August. The description is utterly false, utterly lacking
in authenticity. On the other hand, when “Mr. Fishback
of the Sulphurs” relates how one hot day in
December when he was riding home he saw a blue
norther coming behind him, put spurs to his horse, and,
racing for miles with the nose of the wind at his very
backbone, arrived at the stable to find the hind-quarters
of his horse frozen stiff whereas the fore-quarters were
in a lather of sweat—such a hair’s breadth doth divide
the hot prelude to a norther from the iciness of the
norther itself—we realize that we are in the company
of a liar as authentic as he is accomplished. Surely
such do not violate the ninth commandment; indeed
they have become as little children.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>The pioneers who came to Texas to found a cattle
industry that eventually extended from the Río Grande
to the Big Bow brought with them from the older
Southwestern frontier a large body of floating literature
of the tall tale variety. The influence of this folk
material is clearly discernible in the works of Longstreet,
and Baldwin, and other Southern humorists
who preceded Mark Twain.</p>

<p>The literary use of the tall tale in the South seems
to have been checked by the Civil War, but after that
struggle it found a congenial home and flourished
orally in the cow-camps of the new Southwest. While
it is true that the cowboy deserves his reputation for
reticence and reserve, it is also true that when conditions
were favorable to the exercise of the art of story
telling, he often proved an inveterate liar. Among the
cattlemen of a generation ago books and periodicals
were scarce, and all sorts of shifts were resorted to for
amusement. It is a tribute to the cowboy’s adaptability
that he was able to utilize as well as he did the resources
at his command. So, while the gifted story-teller was
often referred to disparagingly as a “windy,” he was
welcome around the camp-fires, and any large outfit
was likely to have one or more among its numbers.</p>

<p>Old tales that were applicable to the new conditions
survived; others were adapted to the new environment;
Crèvecoeur and Münchausen seem to have supplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</span>
others, though of course there is no proof that the
Southwestern analogues were not of independent
origin. The adaptations, if they were such, often
exhibit admirable ingenuity. Still other tales grew
directly out of the soil.</p>

<p>The cowboy liked horseplay, and took keen delight
in “loading” the greenhorn. This pastime, which usually
occupied the hours after supper in the evening, consisted
in telling for the benefit of the uninitiated a
species of yarn locally known as the “windy.” If the
auditor appeared credulous, the narrators went on
vying with each other, heaping exaggeration upon
exaggeration, consciously burlesquing the misconceptions
which the newcomer had brought with him from
the East. Sometimes the listener was informed by a
sell at the end of the story that he had been taken in;
more often he was made aware of the fact by the
sheer heights of exaggeration to which the narrative
ascended; occasionally he accepted the story in good
faith and went away neither sadder nor wiser. The
good story-teller, then, did not demand credence. All
he wanted was a sympathetic listener. His reward was
the joy of mere narrative.</p>

<p>The result was a literature at once imaginative,
robust, and humorous: one in striking contrast to the
better known pensive and melancholy ballads, which,
taken in themselves, present a one-sided picture of the
cowboy’s character.</p>

<p>Since much of the cowboy’s romancing was done to
inspire fear in the newcomer, the fauna of the Southwest,
really comparatively harmless, was represented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</span>
as dangerous in the extreme. And among the living
things none was better adapted to the cowboy’s purpose
than the rattlesnake. As a matter of fact, there were
few fatalities from snake-bite among cowmen. The
rattlesnake rarely strikes without warning. He presents
no danger to mounted men; and when dismounted, the
cowboy was afforded good protection by his boots. Yet
because of his terrifying aspect, his blood-curdling
rattle, and the reputation he had acquired in the East,
the rattlesnake was an especial source of terror to the
greenhorn; and he was the subject of many a harrowing
tale told around the campfire, frequently as a prelude
to some practical joke. This means of entertainment
was a well established custom in the days of
Big Foot Wallace.</p>

<p>If the existing fauna could not be made impressive
enough, imaginary animals could be drafted into service.
These mythological creatures were numerous, and
were not completely standardized either in terminology
or in anatomy. Some were harmless, and the point of
the story was to “sell” the greenhorn. Others were
extremely ferocious, and the tenderfoot was advised
to avoid them under all circumstances. He also received
minute instruction in the technique of escaping when
pursued. Like all mythological animals, they were
compounded of the parts of well-known species.</p>

<p>The greenhorn’s misconceptions and his conduct
arising therefrom were frequent themes of western
windies, as well as of tales of actual fact.</p>

<p>Another favorite subject of cowboy yarns was the
weather. The changeableness of atmospheric conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</span>
in the Southwest has long been proverbial, and many
a fantastic yarn has been spun to illustrate this fickleness
of weather.</p>

<p>A different type of tall tale was that involving narrow
and ingenious escapes and hair-raising adventures.
This sort of tale demanded a hero, but the cowboy’s
love of exaggeration did not lead him into supernaturalism.
The hero of his fiction was a mere mortal
who possessed to a high degree endurance, agility, and
the other qualities which the cowboy of necessity
exemplified, and which he consequently admired. The
hero of the cowboy’s tall tale could drink his coffee
boiling hot and wipe his mouth on a prickly-pear. He
could ride a tornado, but he was not a giant, the impact
of whose body in being thrown from one would form
the Great Basin of the West; and those who have
attributed to him such a prodigious stature have
written too much under the influence of the Paul
Bunyan legend.</p>

<p>Nor did cowboy fiction ever become unified around
a single character. When a hero was needed, his name
might be invented on the spot; the feats of daring
might be ascribed to some local character; or the
narrator himself might appropriate the honors. Certain
names, however, were in rather general use, California
Joe and Texas Jack being among the more common.</p>

<p>The nearest living parallel to Don Quixote (in outward
circumstances at least) that I ever saw was an
impersonator of one of these legendary heroes.</p>

<p>Several years ago a man came to Sweetwater, Texas,
and announced that he was <i>the original</i> Texas Jack.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</span>
He wore khaki trousers tucked in “hand-me-down”
boots somewhat run over at the heels. He had on a red
flannel shirt and bandanna. What drew attention for
at least a block was an elaborate belt with holster attached.
The belt was four inches wide, and had evidently
been fashioned from a “back-band” belonging to
a set of heavy draft harness. It was heavily studded
with brass and glistened in the sun. The holster, when
examined by officers, showed no evidence of ever having
contained a pistol.</p>

<p>Texas Jack seemed quite harmless. He walked the
streets for a few days and entertained whoever would
listen to him with long stories about his exploits in
arresting bad men, a type which he said was very
numerous in the Panhandle of Texas. It seemed that
when the Rangers were at a loss what to do, they sent
for Texas Jack, who always brought back his man and
turned him over to the law. His technique was quite
simple. He merely walked in and got the bad man by
the ear and led him to jail while the nonplussed officers
looked on in astonishment.</p>

<p>I later saw him at Maryneal, a village twenty miles
south of Sweetwater. There he had an antiquated
singleshot, twenty-two calibre rifle, which he handled
so carelessly that he was arrested. I never learned the
outcome of his sanity trial.</p>

<p>I never saw anybody claiming to be California Joe
or Pecos Bill.</p>

<p>This latter hero is apparently a late development, for
few of the old-time cowmen have heard of him. Getting
into print in 1923, he seems to be driving his rivals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</span>
from the field, and is the most likely candidate for epic
honors in the Southwest.</p>

<p>Practically all the tales in this collection came directly
from the cattle folk of West Texas, among whom I was
raised (not reared); and some of them are associated
with my earliest memories. Others I have learned more
recently either from cattlemen or from their sons and
daughters who have been my students in the University
of Texas and in the Sul Ross State Teachers College.</p>

<p>I have consulted the available published material on
the tall tale of the cattle country. The bibliography is
short, and not all of the authors who have written
on the subject have had the advantage of a first-hand
acquaintance with the yarns of the region. Aside from
the publications of the Texas Folklore Society, my
chief indebtedness is to Mr. Edward O’Reilly’s “Saga
of Pecos Bill,” published in the <cite>Century Magazine</cite> for
October, 1923 (106: 827-833).</p>

<p>Some of this material I have published in the
<cite>Southwest Review</cite>, the <cite>Texas Monthly</cite>, <cite>The South
Atlantic Quarterly</cite>, and the <cite>Publications</cite> of the West
Texas Historical and Scientific Society.</p>

<h3>PIZENOUS WINDIES</h3>

<p>There was just enough light left in the sky to reveal
the bedded herd. The first night-shift had gone on. One
could see the riders silhouetted against the sky as they
rode around the cattle quieting them with the crooning
melodies of <cite>Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie</cite> and <cite>The
Trail of ’83</cite>.</p>

<p>The men had finished supper. Some had spread their
beds and were lying upon them. They had not yet gone
through the short ritual of going to bed. Others sat
around the campfire. Red Wallace observed that it was
time to hit the hay. As he started to the wagon for his
bed-roll, he stumbled over a small greasewood bush.
A shrill rattle came from underneath. Red jumped
back, picking up a stone.</p>

<p>“You dirty rascal!” he exclaimed. “Thought you’d
bite me, didn’t you? Of all the nerve. Tryin’ to bite me.
You cheeky son-of-a-gun. Wanted to bite me! Take
that.” The rock struck the snake squarely on the head.</p>

<p>“A rattlesnake!” exclaimed Lanky, a tenderfoot of
the high-school age, whom the boss had taken on the
day before, and whom Joe Martin had informally
christened <i>Lanky</i>. “I’ve been wishing all afternoon to
see one.”</p>

<p>“You’ll git to see all them you want to see if you
stay with this outfit, though they ain’t as numerous as
they used to be,” answered Red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>“Are they really as poisonous as they have the
reputation of being?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Pizenous?” asked Red, seating himself on the bed-roll
he had just brought from the wagon. “One of
them cut-throats took off three of the best friends
I ever had in this world.</p>

<p>“You see it was like this. Poker Bill was out ridin’
fence. He gits down to nail up a loose wire, and one
of these reptiles nabs him by the heel. Bill grabs him
by the tail and jist naturally flails the everlastin’ stuffin’
out of him on the fence post. Then Bill takes off his
boot and looks at his heel. The fang ain’t teched the
skin; so he puts back on his boot and goes on his way,
thinkin’ nothin’ of it. About a week afterwards Bill
gits a sore heel. He comes in one day at dinner and
tells the boss he can’t work that evenin’ and he lays
down on his bunk and we goes off and leaves him.
When we comes in at night, there lays pore Bill a
corpse.</p>

<p>“He must have knowed he was goin’ to die, ’cause
there on a piece of paper was his will all wrote out.
It says, ‘My saddle to Red, my bridle to Pete, and my
boots to Ed.’</p>

<p>“Well, we buries pore Bill, havin’ a swell funeral
with a circuit-rider to do the preachin’. Ed, out of
respect to the deceased, wears the boots to the funeral.
Purty soon he gits a sore heel. ‘Bill’s boots,’ he says,
‘are a little too big. They made a blister on my heel.’
One mornin’ he takes to his bunk, sayin’ he guessed
his sock had pizened his heel. That night he breathes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
his last. Fine man he was, too. They don’t make better
men than Ed Wilson.</p>

<p>“Jist before he dies, he calls us all to his bedside
and says, ‘Boys, I’m goin’ to the big round-up. I ain’t
been as righteous as I ought to of been, but I’m hopin’
the Big Range Boss will cut me into his herd. Dave,
you can have my bridle; Red, you can take my saddle;
and Pete, you can have my boots.’ Them was the last
words he ever spoke.</p>

<p>“Ed’s family asks us to send the corpse back to Virginia,
which we does, me going along with it. And
I meets Ed’s family and tells them what a fine man
he was, and how he always done his duty, and ever’thing.
And fine folks they was, too.</p>

<p>“When I gits back to the ranch, I finds pore Pete
all laid out for the undertaker. ‘He died of the sore
heel,’ says the boss, ‘jist like Bill and Ed. He says
give his boots to you.’</p>

<p>“By this time I was gittin’ suspicious. I takes the
boots and examines them close, and there in the spur-piece
of the left boot is the fang of that dirty, low-down,
cut-throat reptile. I takes the pliers and pulls
out the fang, and to make shore it don’t cause any
more devilment, I takes a spade and buries it at the
back of the bunk-house.</p>

<p>“Then I puts on the boots and wears them right on.
This is them I got on now. See that place right there
that looks like a pinhole? That’s where I pulled the
critter’s fang out.”</p>

<p>“I guess it didn’t do any more harm,” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“None to speak of,” replied Red. “The boss’s old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
hound dawg comes along and sees where I buried the
fang, and he forgits but what he’d buried a bone there,
and he begins diggin’ like a fool. Purty soon his paw
swells up, and we have to shoot him. But as far as I
know that was the end and the extent of that reptile’s
devilment.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said Hank. “That puts me in mind
of a thing that happened to Jess Simpson and me jest
before I joined this outfit. We was goin’ to a rodeo
at Vega in Jess’s flivver, and jest before we gits to
Lubbock, we sees a rattlesnake in the road ahead of us.
‘Watch me git him,’ says Jess, and jest as the critter
raises his head to strike, Jess busts him one right in
the mouth with the front tire of his Ford. ‘One less
venomous reptile in the world,’ says Jess, and we
drives on thinkin’ that’s all of that.</p>

<p>“Jest as we gits to Lubbock, Jess notices that a tire
is nearly down. He pulls up to a little garage in the edge
of town and has it fixed, and then we goes on. When
we gits to Plainview, we notices that the tire is nearly
flat again; so he has it fixed there. Then we goes on
to the rodeo, and Jess wins a hundred dollars bull-doggin’,
and me seventy-five goat-ropin’, which we
spends and starts home.</p>

<p>“We gits back to Plainview and stops at the same
garage where we had our tire fixed comin’ up, and we
notices a new man changin’ tires. ‘Where’s the feller
that was here last week?’ says Jess. ‘He was so good
to us and fixed our tire so good I thought I’d bring
him a little snake medicine,’ says Jess, sort of winkin’.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>“‘Pore feller. We buried him yesterday,’ says the
man. ‘His hand all swole up and he died.’</p>

<p>“‘Now ain’t that too bad,’ says Jess. ‘Fine man he
was. I never seen him till we stopped here last week
on our way to Vega, but soon as I looked him in the
eye, I says to my pal here (meanin’ me), ‘There’s a
fine feller. I’m sort of funny that way,’ he says. ‘When
I first see a man, I can look him in the eye and tell
whether he’s any ’count or not.’</p>

<p>“‘Tell his family that two of his true friends lament
his death,’ I says. ‘I reckon we better be gittin’ on.’</p>

<p>“We drives on wonderin’ if that dirty reptile did
cause the pore feller’s death. ‘We’ll stop at Lubbock,’
says Jess, ‘and see if the feller there is all right.’ And
so we drives up to the little garage, which is a one-man
outfit, and there was a woman runnin’ it.</p>

<p>“‘Where is the man that was here last week?’ says I.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, my husband?’ says the woman. ‘We laid him
away last Tuesday,’ tears comin’ in her eyes as she
spoke.</p>

<p>“‘I’m a pore cowpuncher,’ say I, ‘and I spent all my
money at the rodeo, but I’ll write you a draft on the
boss for a month’s wages, and it’ll be honored too, you
needn’t be worried about that.’</p>

<p>“‘I’ll do the same,’ says Jess.</p>

<p>“‘You gentlemen are very kind,’ she says, ‘but I
couldn’t accept it. Besides, our home and business is
paid for, and there’s the insurance money.’</p>

<p>“‘How did it happen?’ asks Jess.</p>

<p>“‘I guess it was blood-pizen,’ she says. ‘His finger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
swelled up, and he got sicker and sicker and died. Are
you all friends of his?’</p>

<p>“‘That we are,’ says Jess, ‘and I want to say right
here that there never was a better man than—than
your husband.’</p>

<p>“‘Naw, there wasn’t,’ says I, ‘and we wish you good
luck. We’ll have to be gittin’ away.’</p>

<p>“We drives off overcome with sorrow on account
of the death of them two men. Sometimes yet when
I’m ridin’ along by myself, I think of them in their
graves, and I feel that me and Jess somehow had a
hand in it, and I’d jest give my hoss and saddle if it
hadn’t happened. Naw, sir, Lanky. If you see one of
them critters in the road, don’t run over him. You
might be the innocent means of takin’ off several
lives.”</p>

<p>The fire had died to a bed of coals. It was no longer
possible to see the night herders, but the indistinct
songs reached the camp. Lanky was seated on his bed-roll.
The sitters had dwindled to four.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know they were that bad,” observed Lanky.</p>

<p>“That bad!” said Joe Martin. Joe was a veteran of
the open range and of the overland trail. Far and near
he was known by the name of “Windy Joe,” but
Lanky had not learned of this last fact.</p>

<p>“That bad!” said Joe again. “Them snakes that
Red and Hank told you about must of been baby
snakes. They couldn’t of been real, he-men, venomous
reptiles like the one that killed Ike Morgan. Ike was
one of the best friends I ever had in this world. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
worked on the Yellow House when Red and Hank
here was wearin’ foldin’ britches.</p>

<p>“Ike was some cowhand, even if he did have a
wooden leg. I reckon I might as well tell you how he
got his wooden leg, while I’m about it. You see it was
like this. Ike was ridin’ the range one winter day, and
as he started up a little canyon, his hoss fell and caught
Ike’s leg. The critter broke two of his own legs in the
fall, and there he was on Ike’s leg and couldn’t git up.
And there was pore Ike wonderin’ if he’d starve before
anybody found him.</p>

<p>“Purty soon Ike smelled a norther, and the next thing
he knowed, the norther was there, and the next thing
he knowed after that, he had icicles on his nose. Ike
knowed he’d freeze to death, and that <i>muy pronto</i> if he
didn’t find some way to git loose. He figgered and
figgered. That was one thing about Ike, he always
used his head. Well, he figgered and figgered, and
purty soon he looked around, and he seen an axe about
a hundred yards off. He ’lowed some nester had been
haulin’ wood out of the canyon and had lost his axe.
And mighty glad Ike was of the nester’s hard luck, too.
And jest to show you the nerve of the man, he goes
over and gits the axe and chops off his own leg, and
he didn’t have any chloroform, either, it not bein’
wormy season, and gits his self loose and walks ten
miles into headquarters. That’s what I call nerve.</p>

<p>“But what I started out to tell you was how Ike
met his death. The boss sent Ike to town and had the
blacksmith make him a peg-leg. A fine limb it was, too.
Ike had him a stirrup made to fit it, and he could ride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
as good as ever. Many a bronc he peeled after that.
He could dance like a fool, and hold his own in any
shootin’ match that any tough <i>hombre</i> ever started.
Shame it was that he had to be kilt by a dirty reptile.</p>

<p>“Ike was fixin’ fence in the canyon one evenin’ jest
at dusk. He needs a stay for the fence, and he looks
over in the bushes and sees what in the dusk of the
evenin’ looks like a pole. He gits down to pick it up,
and damn me, if it wasn’t one of them low-down
reptiles—a big specimen with twenty-eight rattles and
a button. And the son-of-a-gun nabs Ike by the wooden
leg. That don’t worry Ike much, and while the critter
holds him by the peg, Ike takes out his six-shooter and
sends the gentleman on to his happy huntin’ ground,
cuttin’ off the twenty-eight rattles and the button for
a keepsake—which I now have and will show you some
time if you’ll make me think of it.</p>

<p>“Ike gits on his hoss and rides to the bunkhouse
where me and Ezra Jenkins are, and when he tries to
lift his wooden leg out of the stirrup, it won’t come.
Ezra and me gits the axe and the cold-chisel and cuts
off the stirrup from around the peg and brings Ike
in the house. By that time the leg is as big as a steer,
and it is all we can do to carry him in. Ezra gits his
fencing hatchet and me the choppn’ axe, and we begins
to try to reduce Ike’s leg to its natural and proper size.
We trims and we trims, and the leg swells and swells.
And the more we trims, the more it swells. However,
for the first ten hours we gains on the swellin’, but we
begins to tire and there’s nobody to spell us. I takes
the axe and keeps Ezra busy packing out the chips and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
splinters. We works all night choppin’ and trimmin’ and
packing out, but we gits weaker and weaker, and the
swellin’ keeps gainin’ on us. Finally, after three days,
we jest naturally gives tetotally out, and has to set
down and see pore Ike die.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Lanky, “a bite on the wooden leg
shouldn’t have given him any pain. How did it kill
him?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see it was like this,” replied Joe. “His
leg jest swelled and swelled till it got so big it jest
naturally smothered him to death. Fine feller he was
too, one of the best friends I ever had in this world.”</p>

<p>“There was jest one good thing about it,” added Joe.
“Ezra and me had enough kindling wood to do us all
winter.”</p>

<p>Joe chunked up the fire and put on the coffee pot.</p>

<p>“Have a cigarette?” offered Lanky.</p>

<p>“Roll my own,” said Joe, fishing out a shuck.</p>

<p>It was Hank’s turn. “Too bad about Ike,” he said.
“But I don’t doubt a-tall it’s so, like you say, fer I seen
a similar case. Very similar case, except it wasn’t a
man’s leg.</p>

<p>“Me and Jim Arbury hitched up the hosses one
mornin’ and went out to bring in a little stove-wood.
He headed out towards a little mesquite thicket, and
jest before we got to it, I seen the lead hoss shy.</p>

<p>“‘What’s the matter with old Pete?’ I asks Jim.</p>

<p>“‘What’s the matter with him?’ Jim says. ‘My God,
man,’ says he, ‘look at that reptile! big as a fence post!’</p>

<p>“And shore nuff there’s a great big rattler a-holt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
of the wagon tongue. He’d nabbed it, and he wouldn’t
let go.</p>

<p>“Jim knowed exactly what to do. He jumped down
and pulled out the couplin’ pin, lettin’ the double-tree
go, and drove the team out of the way. ‘Grab the axe,’
he says. Well, I jumped out with the axe and begun
work. I shore hated to do it, but I knowed it had to be
done. I had to chop off the wagon tongue, and be damn
quick about it too, to save the wagon.”</p>

<p>“Them tales of yours and Joe’s jist made me think
how lucky Jack Pierson and me was not to be kilt one
time,” said Red.</p>

<p>“The boss sends us out in the winter time to fence
a section starve-out. We puts up the posts on three sides
and then we finds that the boss hasn’t figgered right,
’cause there ain’t none fer the other side. We starts to
the canyon, thinkin’ we’d have to cut some and snake
’em out. We gits to the rim-rock, and there we sees
what looks like a lot of cedar logs. We remarks on our
good luck and wonders how the timber got there, but
when we drives up close, we finds a bunch of big hibernatin’
reptiles. There was ten thousand, I guess.</p>

<p>“‘Cuss the luck,’ says Jack; ‘I thought we’d found
our posts.’</p>

<p>“‘We have,’ says I; ‘and why ain’t we? Them critters
are big enough and stiff enough. We’ll take ’em
along.’</p>

<p>“‘You’re the doctor,’ says Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, we gathers up the biggest and the <a id="chg1"></a>straightest
and loads ’em in. We find we don’t have to dig post-holes.
I’d stand one of the critters on his tail, and Jack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
would drive him in the ground with a twelve-pound
sledge-hammer. We stapled on the wire, and told the
boss to come out and inspect the job.</p>

<p>“‘Boys,’ he says, ‘you do have a brain, leastways
one between you. You saved at least a week’s work.
I’ll let you go to Kansas City when we ship again.’”</p>

<p>“Was the fence permanent?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“It was till spring,” said Red. “You see, when
spring come, them reptiles jist naturally thawed out and
come to, and crawled off with a whole mile of wire.
Good six-wire fence we had made, too—hog-tight,
horse-high, and bull-strong.”</p>

<p>“Is it true,” asked Lanky, “that rattlesnakes and
king snakes are natural enemies and fight each other?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Joe, “but I’ll tell
what I seen once. Strange thing it was too. I come upon
a king snake and a rattlesnake one time fightin’ for
dear life. Each one would grab the other and then stick
his head under his belly for protection. Finally, jest
at the same time, they nabbed each other by the tail
and begun swallering. There they was, jest like a ring;
and they swallered and swallered, and the ring got
littler and littler. Jest then I heard a panther yell, and
I looked up jest a minute—jest a fraction—and when
I looked again, damn me, if them snakes wasn’t gone.
I looked for ’em I reckon an hour, and it was right out
on the open prairie where there wasn’t any holes or
rocks, and I never could find them critters.”</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>“Now, most rattlers,” said Red, “is jist like bad
men. They’re jist naturally mean and will bite you
when you ain’t lookin’, no matter how kind you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
to them. You’ll find one onct in a while, however,
that’s a purty decent sort of chap. I recollect one in
particular which was a gentlemanly critter.”</p>

<p>“You’re the first man I ever heard speak a good
word for a rattlesnake,” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t make no complaint about the conduct and
behavior of this particular rattlesnake,” said Red. “He
treated me decent enough.”</p>

<p>“What did he do?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Red, “I was fishin’ one time out on the
Pecos, and I run out of bait. What I wanted was
a frog, and I looked and looked, for nearly an hour
and couldn’t find none. Finally I seen a rattlesnake
tryin’ to swaller a big bullfrog. I thinks to myself,
‘Well, I’m goin’ to have that frog, even if I git snake-bit.’
You see I had a bottle of snake medicine in my
pocket—Old Rock and Rye it was.</p>

<p>“I put my foot on that rattlesnake’s tail and took a
holt of that frog’s hind legs, and jist naturally extracted
him right out of the reptile’s mouth. Well, instead of
gittin’ ringy and showin’ fight, like most rattlers
would, this here snake jist looks so sad and down in
the mouth that I couldn’t help feelin’ sorry for the
critter.</p>

<p>“‘Here, old feller; cheer up,’ says I, givin’ him a
swig of Old Rock and Rye out of my bottle. He takes
a dram and crawls off jist as pert as a fresh cuttin’ hoss.</p>

<p>“I puts the frog on my hook and sets down to fish.
Jist as I was about to git a bite, I feels somethin’
tappin’ me on the leg. I looks down, and damn me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
if there ain’t that rattlesnake back with two frogs in
his mouth.”</p>

<p>Hank stirred up the coals and put on a mesquite
grub. Lanky gave him his cue by asking if rattlesnakes
ever got in people’s beds.</p>

<p>“Occasionally,” said Hank. “Occasionally, though
they ain’t as thick as they used to be. One time I woke
up in the night, thinkin’ it was about time for me to
stand guard. I felt something cold on my chest. I
knowed what it was. I says to myself, ‘Now, Hank,
keep cool. Keep cool.’ All the time I was easin’ my
hand back around to the top of my head to git a-holt
of my six-gun. I was as careful as I could be, but
I reckon the critter got on to what I was doin’, for jest
as I was about to touch the gun, he raised up his head
and opened his mouth to strike. Then I let him have a
bullet right in the mouth. That was the quickest draw
I ever made.”</p>

<p>“I got in a fix jest like that one time,” said Joe,
“except, fool like, I didn’t have my gun handy.”</p>

<p>“What did you do?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Joe, “after thinkin’ it over and seein’
there wasn’t nothin’ I could do, I jest shet my eyes
and went back to sleep, and when I woke up in the
morning, the critter was gone. Jest crawled off of his
own free will and accord.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Red, “that shows what a tenderfoot
you was, and Hank, too. If you’d jist of put hair rope
around your bed before you went to sleep, them snakes
wouldn’t of come in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>“I had read that in stories,” said Lanky, “but I
didn’t know if it were really true.”</p>

<p>“True as the gospel,” said Red.</p>

<p>“How does it work?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Tickles their bellies,” replied Red. “A rattlesnake
jist can’t stand ticklin’. One fall when we was workin’,
the cook one night didn’t make camp till dark. Then
we found out he had bedded us in a regular den of
reptiles. We made our beds right up techin’ each other,
and put hair ropes on the ground all around the whole
outfit. The next mornin’ we counted a hundred and
twenty-nine rattlesnakes around the beds. They had jist
naturally tickled their fool selves to death tryin’ to
crawl over the rope.”</p>

<p>“The critters, however, ain’t so numerous as they
used to be in Pecos Bill’s time,” said Joe. “That man
almost put ’em out of business in his day.”</p>

<p>“How did he do that?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Bill was a very smart and ingenious lad,” said Joe.
“He was the first man to capture a whiffle-poofle; he
was the first man to train prairie-dogs to dig post-holes;
and he was the first man to do a lot of things.
Among other things he invented a way to slay rattlesnakes
wholesale. When Bill wanted to capture or
exterminate any sort of reptile or bird or beast, he
would study the critter’s habits and find out what his
weakness was; then he would go off and study and
study, and purty soon he would come back with a way
all figgered out. Bill always used his head. He put in two
of the best years of his life studyin’ rattlesnakes. Not
that Bill was afraid of ’em. But one of the critters bit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
his horse one time, and then he got mad. But he never
let on. He jest went out and made friends with ’em
and lived with ’em, and noticed their habits and their
diet and where they liked to live at different times of
the year, and all that.</p>

<p>“Bill discovered that rattlesnakes had rather have
moth-balls to eat than anything under the sun. A rattlesnake
will leave a young and tender rabbit any day for
a moth-ball. Bill found out likewise that a rattlesnake
jest can’t stand chili powder. Those two clues give him
an idear. First he took some chili powder and soaked
it in nitroglycerin. He rolled this into little pills and
coated them with moth-ball.</p>

<p>“Then he took these balls and scattered ’em around
where the reptiles stayed. Well, the critters would come
out and find the moth-balls and swaller ’em right down,
not thinkin’ there might be a ketch somewheres. Purty
soon the outside coating would melt off, and the chili
powder would burn the critters on the inside. This
would make ’em mad, and they’d beat their tails against
the ground and rocks, which exploded the nitroglycerin
and blowed ’em into smithereens. We used to kill ’em
that way here on the ranch, but the boss made us quit
after one of the critters crawled under a steer and
blowed him into atoms.”</p>

<p>“I’d think that would be a rather dangerous method,”
said Lanky. “But what is that whiffle-poofle you mentioned
a few minutes ago?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll learn when you git a little older,” replied
Joe. “You’d better hit the hay now, Lanky. You stand
next guard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Lanky bent down to untie his bed-roll. Then he
jumped straight into the air. “My God, I’m bitten!”
he yelled.</p>

<p>“Bring the butcher knife and the coal-oil,” said
Hank, “and heat a brandin’ iron.”</p>

<p>“Spect we ought to cut his hand off right now before
the pizen spreads,” said Red. “Where’s the axe?”</p>

<p>“Now, lad, don’t let ’em buffalo you,” said Joe. “You
ain’t bit a-tall.”</p>

<p>“But there’s blood on my hand,” said Lanky; “see.”</p>

<p>“That’s a shore sign you ain’t bit,” said Joe. “That’s
the snake’s blood; see. That’s the very snake Red kilt.”</p>

<p>“But he struck me,” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“Shore he did. Them devilish critters will strike
after they have their heads cut off. Reflex. That’s what
they call it. Dirty trick they played on you.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said Red. “The critter’s head is gone.
Still I think we better cut his hand off to make shore.
Them things is so pizenous the bite might kill him anyway.
I seen a man bit jist like that one time....”</p>

<p>“And he never was right in his head again,” said
Hank.</p>

<p>“Which one of you was it?” asked Lanky.</p>

<h3>SPEED</h3>

<p>On Lanky’s second night in the cow camp, there
were many allusions to his snake-bite.</p>

<p>“Now, Lanky, watch out for rattlesnakes and don’t
git bit again,” said Hank.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll recover without an operation,” said
Red, “but still I think we ought to of cut your hand
off. No tellin’ what might happen. Ought to be on the
safe side.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let ’em buffalo you, Lanky; don’t let ’em
buffalo you,” said Joe. “You ain’t such a greenhorn as
lots of chaps I’ve seen. Why, when Red here first come
to this outfit, he was so ign’rant he didn’t know split
beans from coffee. He thought you had to have a gun
to shoot craps; he thought a dogie was somethin’ you
built houses out of. He thought a lasso was a girl, and
<i>remuda</i> a kind of grass. When the boss got ringy,
Red said he was a wrangler. Why, he even thought
a cowboy was a bull.”</p>

<p>“He was nearly as bad as old <i>Borrego</i> Mason’s
sheep-herder,” said Hank. “I reckon Joe’s told you
about him, ain’t he, Lanky?—No?</p>

<p>“Well, a guy comes down from the East and tries
to git a job runnin’ cattle. He ’lowed he’s jest graduated
from college—Harvard or Yale, or some of them big
schools up there. Said he’d been a big athlete and
played in all sorts of games and run in big foot races,
and the like. ’Lowed he come to Texas to be a big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
rancher. He said, though, he’d be willin’ to begin at the
bottom and work his way up, and for the time bein’
he’d take a job as a common cowhand.</p>

<p>“Well, he went to all the outfits in the whole country,
and he couldn’t git anybody to take him on.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Well, it was mostly on account of his lingo. He
wouldn’t talk United States, like other people. He
wouldn’t ask for a job. He was wantin’ a ‘position’ or
‘employment,’ with a ‘future’ to it. And he wouldn’t
say ‘wages’, but always asked about ‘remuneration’ and
‘emolument’ and the like. Some of the bosses didn’t
know what the hell he was talkin’ about; some of ’em
said he must be a rustler; and others said they wouldn’t
hire a damn foreigner until he learned to talk United
States, or at least Mex’can.</p>

<p>“And so the pore feller had to hire himself to a
damn sheep man. It nearly broke his heart. It makes
me sorry for the pore fool every time I think of it.</p>

<p>“And when Old Man Mason took him down to the
sheep pens and turned out the <i>borregos</i>, and the pore
greenhorn seen he was goin’ to have to walk, he jest
naturally broke down and cried. He told Old Man
Mason that his sweetheart back East had jest died and
that he’d come out West to git over it.</p>

<p>“Old Man Mason told him the first thing to do was
to take them sheep out to graze. He told him to be
shore to git ’em back by night, and to be damn shore
to look after the lambs and git every one of ’em back
in the pen. If he didn’t there’d be some tall hell-raisin’
in the camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“Old Man Mason went back to his shack and set in
the shade all day. Finally it was might nigh dark, and
the herder hadn’t come in with the woollies. The Old
Man waited a while longer, and still the herder didn’t
show up. About nine o’clock he started out to the pens
about three hundred yards from the house, to see if he
could see anything of the critters. On the way out
he met his new sheep-herder.</p>

<p>“‘Did you have any trouble with the sheep?’ says he.</p>

<p>“‘Not with the sheep,’ says the herder. ‘But,’ he
says, ‘the lambs occasioned me considerable annoyance
and perturbation.’</p>

<p>“Well, Old Man Mason didn’t know what the hell
he meant, and he didn’t want to ask, for fear he’d
appear ign’rant; so went on to the pens to see what
was the matter with the lambs.</p>

<p>“The moon was up, and he could see over the rock
fence. The sheep was all huddled up in the middle of
the pen, and the Old Man counted a hundred and
seventy-five jack-rabbits runnin’ around and buttin’ the
fence, doin’ their damndest to git out.”</p>

<p>“I got up considerable speed once myself,” said Joe,
“once when I was a good deal younger than I am
now; but it wasn’t no rabbit that I was chasin’; it was
a prairie-fire.”</p>

<p>“You mean it was the prairie-fire chasing you, don’t
you?” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“Naw,” said Joe. “It was jest as I was sayin’. I was
chasin’ the prairie-fire. It wasn’t the prairie-fire
chasin’ me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“It was back in the early days one time when I was
out huntin’ cattle on the plains. One day in August,
I recken it was, I follered off some cow tracks and got
lost from the outfit. I was out two days without nothin’
to eat. Finally I come on a little herd of buffalo. I
shoots a good fat cow and cuts off a piece of tenderloin.</p>

<p>“Well, when I begins to look around for somethin’
to cook it with, not a thing can I find. There ain’t
a stick of timber, not a twig, nor a dry buffalo chip
nowhere around there. I was hungry enough to have
et that meat raw and bloody, and I needed it too, for
I was so hungry that I was weak in the knees. But
somehow I never was much of a raw meat eater. It
ain’t civilized.</p>

<p>“Well, as I was sayin’, I couldn’t find no regular
fuel; so I calkilated I’d try the prairie grass, which
was long and curly and dry. I gathers up a big pile,
puts the hunk of meat on my ramrod and holds it over
the grass and lights a match. Jest one flash and the
fire’s all gone, except the wind comes up all at once
and sets the dang prairie on fire.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I takes out after that prairie-fire, holdin’
my meat over the blaze. It would burn along purty
regular for a while; then all of a sudden it would give
a big jump and tear out across the plains like hell after
a wild woman, and I’d have to do my dangest to keep
up with it. Well, I chased that prairie-fire about three
hours, I recken, but I finally got my meat cooked. I et
it—and it shore did taste good, too—and started back
across the burnt country to where I had shot the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
buffalo. Damn me, if I hadn’t run so far in three
hours that it took me two days to git back. There my
hoss was waitin’ fer me, and I found the outfit the
next day.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that was purty good runnin’,” said Red.
“But you nor the feller Hank was a-tellin’ about either
wasn’t as swift as one of them college chaps we had
on an outfit where I worked once. Not near so swift.
Been a good thing for him if he hadn’t been so fast.
Too swift for his own good.”</p>

<p>“How was that?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Here’s the way it was,” said Red. “He was a
greenhorn, but he was a-learnin’ fast. Would of made
a good cowhand, pore feller. He got to be a purty
good shot with a Winchester and six-shooter both,
and he was always practicin’ on rabbits and coyotes
and prairie-dogs, and things. Then he decided he’d
have a lot of critters mounted and send ’em back to
his folks.</p>

<p>“Well, he gits everything he wants but a prairie-dog,
but he jist can’t git a-holt of one of them critters.”</p>

<p>“Are they hard to hit?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Oh, he could hit ’em all right. He got so he could
plug ’em right in the eye, but they always jumped in
their holes and got away. They’ll do it every time,
Lanky; they’ll do it every time. Why, one day he took
his forty-five Winchester and shot one of the critters
clean in two, but the front-end grabbed the hind-end
and run down the hole with it before he could git there.</p>

 alt="he runs to beat hell">
<p class="caption">“Jist as he pulls the trigger, he runs to beat hell.”</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>“Well, he asked the boss if there was any way he
could git one, and the boss told him to take good aim,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
and jist as soon as he pulled the trigger to run jist
as fast as he could and maybe he’d git there in time
to grab the critter before he got away.</p>

<p>“Well, he goes out and finds a prairie dog a-settin’
on his hole a-barkin’ in the sun. He pulls out his six-shooter
and takes a good aim at the critter’s eye, and
jist as soon as he pulls the trigger, he runs to beat
hell, jist like the boss told him to. He got there in time,
all right, and bent down to grab the prairie-dog; but
jist as he touched it, the bullet hit him in the back jist
below the left shoulder-blade. When we found him that
evenin’, he was crippled so bad we had to shoot him.
Too bad, too, for he had the makin’s of a first-class
cowhand.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” said Joe, “them guys you all been tellin’
about was mighty swift, but you don’t have to go back
East to find speed. Why, I’ve seen an old cowhand
that growed up right here in Texas that could of beat
any of them Eastern fellers.</p>

<p>“Tell you what I saw once. One day after the spring
work was over, a bunch of us decided to have a baseball
game. Well, we chose up, but we <a id="chg5"></a>liked one man
havin’ enough men for two teams.</p>

<p>“‘What we gonna do?’ says I. ‘I guess we’ll have
to git along with two fielders on our side,’</p>

<p>“Pete Dawson spoke up and says, ‘All you men git
in the field, and I’ll pitch and ketch both.’</p>

<p>“And damn me, if that’s not what he done. He got
on the pitcher’s box, which was a prairie-dog hole, and
he’d throw a ball so it whistled like a bullet; then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
run in a half circle and git behind the batter and
ketch it.</p>

<p>“Not a batter ever teched the ball. It was jest three
up and three down with them, and there wasn’t nothin’
for the rest of us to do.</p>

<p>“When it was Pete’s bat, he’d jest knock a slow
grounder out toward first, and he’d make a home run
before the first-baseman could git a-holt of the ball. We
beat ’em ninty-six to nothin’.</p>

<p>“One time Pete was with us when we was movin’
a bunch of wild Mexico steers. One night the fool
brutes stampeded. We all jumped on our hosses to try
to turn ’em and git ’em to millin’.</p>

<p>“We all had good hosses, especially Pete, who had
a fine hoss he’s won lots of money with; but we couldn’t
git ahead of them steers. They was jest too swift for us.</p>

<p>“Directly Pete jumps off and takes his slicker and
six-shooter with him. He circles around, and in no
time, after tromping about a half a dozen jackrabbits
to death, he’s in front of that herd.</p>

<p>“We all expects to see him git kilt, but he jest trots
along in front of the critters wavin’ his slicker and
firin’ his six-shooter. After he’d run that way about
ten miles, the herd got to millin’ and purty soon they
quieted down, and we never had no more trouble
with ’em.</p>

<p>“That jest naturally took all the pertness and spirit
out of them brutes. They was so ashamed of themselves
that from then on out they was as gentle as
a bunch of milk cows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“The only thing that hurt Pete was that when it was
over, his nose was bleedin’ like six-bits.”</p>

<p>“Got too hot, I suppose,” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“Naw,” said Joe, “that wasn’t it. The bleedin’ was
from the outside. He jest run so fast that the wind
jest naturally peeled all the hide off his nose, and he
had to keep it tied up for about ten days till he growed
some more skin.”</p>

<p>“I bet a hoss and saddle,” said Red, “that he couldn’t
of turned old man Coffey’s bull like that. That brute
had speed. One time old man Coffey shipped out a
train-load of cattle from where he was ranchin’ on the
Lapan Flat; and this here bull decides he wants to go
with ’em. They cut him back, and the train pulls out
in the night.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, the next mornin’ them cowpunchers looks
out the caboose winder, and there’s that bull trottin’
along by the train, bellerin’ and pawin’ up the dust, and
hookin’ at the telegraph poles as he passes ’em by. He
follered that train all the way to Kansas City and had
to be shipped back.</p>

<p>“The fellers started to sell him to the packers jist
for spite, but they knowed old man Coffey never would
git over it if they did.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I heard of that critter,” said Joe. “Fact is
I rode a hundred miles jest to see him once, but I
didn’t git to.</p>

<p>“We gits to old man Coffey’s place about dinner
time, and we goes in and asks if he’s home.</p>

<p>“‘Naw, he ain’t at home right now,’ says his wife.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
‘Git down and look at your saddles, and come in and
eat.’</p>

<p>“‘Where is he this mornin’?’ I asks.</p>

<p>“‘He left ’bout nine o’clock,’ she says. ‘He’s goin’
over to Phoenix. Said he might go by Roswell.’</p>

<p>“‘I reckon we won’t git to see him,’ I says.</p>

<p>“‘Jest unsaddle your hosses,’ she says. ‘I look for
him back about an hour by sun, that is, if he don’t
have no hard luck.’</p>

<p>“‘Wonder if you could tell us where his fast bull
is?’ I says. ‘We come over to see him.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh,’ she says, ‘he’s ridin’ the bull. That’s how
I know he’ll git back tonight.’”</p>

<p>“I reckon that bull could of outrun a milamo bird,”
said Hank.</p>

<p>“No doubt he could,” said Joe. “No doubt he could.”</p>

<p>“What is a milamo bird like?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>But Joe forestalled Hank by saying, “Lanky, you
didn’t git enough sleep last night, what with all that
rattlesnake skeer. I seen you noddin’ while Hank was
a-tellin’ about that sheepherder of Old Man Mason’s,
though I couldn’t blame you much for that. Go to bed,
son, and maybe we’ll see a milamo bird tomorrow.”</p>

<h3>BIRDS AND BEASTS</h3>

<p>It was Lanky’s third night in cow camp. The herd
had been bedded, and the first night shift had gone on.
Lanky, sore of muscle, but extremely contented, sat
by the fire with Red Wallace, Hank Williams, and Joe
Martin, the men who on the first night had imparted
to him the esoteric lore of the rattlesnake, and who on
the second night had entertained him with yarns of
marvelous speed.</p>

<p>Lanky had proved a good listener. He had done his
best to appear credulous. He had interrupted seldom,
and when he had, he had always followed his cue,
and had propounded only the questions that the narrators
wanted him to ask. It is not surprising, therefore,
that on this night the older men were loaded for him.</p>

<p>It was Red Wallace that discharged the first missile.</p>

<p>“We ’as speakin’ of milamo birds last night,” he
observed. “I seen sign today, lots of sign.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny; I done that very same thing,” said
Hank. “I seen, I reckon, a hundred holes where they’d
been feedin’.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose we’re likely to see any of them?”
asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Not likely,” said Joe, “not likely. They’re mighty
scerce these days, mighty scerce, and mighty shy,
mighty shy. I ain’t seen one in years. You might keep
your eye peeled though; we might happen on one any
time. We might. You never can tell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>“Yeah, we might,” broke in Hank. “Still we’re more
likely to hear one than to see one. They’ve got a way
of knowin’ when somebody’s about, though he’s a mile
off. Yeah, they’re mighty hard to see, ’specially these
days; mighty hard to see.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a bird is the milamo?” asked Lanky.
“What is he like?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” replied Hank, “he’s like a milamo. They
ain’t nothin’ else jest like him.”</p>

<p>“Is he large or small?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“He’s rather large,” said Hank, “though not as big
as an ostrich I reckon, though somewhat bigger than
a crane, which he somewhat resembles in general makeup
and conformation.</p>

<p>“In the fall when the rains comes and fills up the
lakes, like they are now, the critters comes in, or used
to, and feeds around the edges of the water. They’ve
got long legs like stilts for wadin’ in the water, a long
neck, and a long beak that they uses to bore into the
soft ground for the earthworms, which is their principal
food and diet.</p>

<p>“I ain’t talkin’ about the little puny earthworms like
school boys use to fish with. Naw, sir, a milamo bird
would be ashamed of his self if he et one of them kind.
He digs down into the ground and ketches the big
fellers, shore-nuff he-man worms that looks like inner-tubes.
I’ve seen holes you could hide a hoss’s leg in
where them critters ’ad been escavatin’ for grub. More
than one good cow hoss has had to be shot from steppin’
in holes that these birds has made, not to say nothin’
of the good cow-hands that has had their necks broke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“But as I was sayin’ about the milamo bird, he jest
has a way of knowin’ where the big worms lives, and
when he comes to a place where he knows one of them
big fellers is all curled up takin’ a nap down under
the ground, he sticks his bill into the soil and begins
to bore and bore, walkin’ around and around. Purty
soon his bill goes out of sight, then his head, then his
neck, clean up to his shoulders. That’s the way you
can slip up on one of ’em. If you can ketch him in jest
that stage, maybe you can git sight of him.</p>

<p>“Well, he bores around a while in the hole he has
dug; then all at once he sets back like a hoss when
there’s a big steer on the other end of the rope; and
you know then he’s got a-holt of one of them big
worms. The more he pulls, the more the worm
stretches. If he lets up the least bit, the worm jerks
his head and neck back into the hole. I seen one once
a-bobbin’ up and down like that for two hours and
fifteen minutes before he finally got his worm.</p>

<p>“Well, he pulls and tussles and yanks and jerks, and
finally the worm jest can’t stand it no longer and has
to let go. He shoots out jest like a nigger-shooter when
you turn it loose, and like as not he hits the milamo
in the eye. But he’s a good-natured bird and don’t git
ringy about it. Jest why he does it, I don’t know;
maybe he’s so glad to git the worm out, or maybe he
sees the joke’s on him, after all; anyhow, when the
worm comes out and hits him in the eye, he jest
naturally gits tickled and rears back on his hind legs
and laughs through his beak so you can hear him a
mile or more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“I see,” said Lanky. “A strange bird.”</p>

<p>“But mighty shy,” replied Hank, “mighty shy.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, they’re shy critters all right,” agreed Joe,
“but they ain’t near as shy as the whiffle-pooffle. Why,
them things is so bashful they don’t feel comfortable
unless they’re hid in the bottom of a bottomless lake.”</p>

<p>“Are they a fish?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Not exactly a fish,” explained Joe, “a sort of cross,
I reckon, between an eel and a gila monster.”</p>

<p>“Are there any around here?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe,” replied Joe; “maybe a few. Still I
doubt it. You see right around here the lakes go dry
sometimes in the dry season, and the whiffle-pooffle
wants water, and plenty of it, <i>mucha agua</i>. Still there
may be a few. Out in the Roswell country, they used
to be numerous. Also in Toyah Creek and Leon waterholes.
I expect, though, they’re gittin’ scerce out in
them parts now. All game is gittin’ scerce. Still, them
critters is mighty hard to ketch, and it’s jest a few
that knows how to do it. Mighty few in fact.”</p>

<p>“Do people fish for them, then?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Some does,” replied Joe, “but it ain’t no use to
fish for ’em with a regular fishin’ outfit. I’ve seen
them rich dudes from the East come out with their
fine tackle, rods and reels and all that fool finery, and
fish and fish for ’em all day long and never git a
nibble. Still they can be caught.”</p>

<p>“How does one catch them?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“So far as I know it was Pecos Bill that discovered
the method. Durin’ Pecos Bill’s time there was a lot
of people that didn’t believe there was any sech animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
as the whiffle-pooffle livin’ in the bottom of the lakes.
Bill said he knowed there was, and he’d show ’em. So
he studied and studied, and finally he found a way to
capture the critters. First he gits together a rowboat,
a long post-hole auger, and a can of oil. Then he hunts
up the funniest story-teller he can find and takes him
along and sets out.</p>

<p>“He rows out on the lake to where the water’s deep;
then he takes the post-hole auger and bores a hole
clean down to the bottom so as the whiffle-pooffle can
come up to the top. Then he has the story-teller tell
the funniest stories he can think of—all about Pat
and Mike and an Englishman and a Scotchman, and
all that.</p>

<p>“Purty soon the whiffle-pooffle gits interested and
pricks up his ears. Then Bill tells the story-teller to git
funnier. Then purty soon the whiffle-pooffle is so
amused that he comes up through the hole and sticks
out his head. Bill tells the man to keep on gittin’ funnier
and funnier till the whiffle-pooffle comes clean out on
top of the water. Then Bill begins to ply the oars, very
gentle-like at first. The whiffle-pooffle is so interested
and amused that he jest naturally can’t help but foller
the story-teller, who all the time is gittin’ funnier and
funnier. Bill rows faster and faster, all the time
makin’ straight for the bank.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
 <img src="images/057.jpg"
 alt="whifflepooffle">
 <p class="caption">“Purty soon the whiffle-pooffle gits interested and pricks up his ears.”</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>“Jest before he gits there, when he is rowin’ as
fast as he can, he pours the oil out on the water and
cuts sharply to the left. By that time the whiffle-pooffle
has got up so much speed on the slick water that he
can’t stop, and he jest naturally slides right out on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
the bank. Then Pecos Bill lands on him. If you ever
git one of the critters on the land, he’s jest as helpless
as a year-old baby. But they’re mighty bashful, mighty
bashful.”</p>

<p>“In that particular, thay ain’t a-tall like the club-tailed
glyptodont,” said Red, “which is a very ferocious
and vicious beast. I’ll tell you, Lanky, when
you’re ridin’ around in the canyons and meet one of
them fellers, you’d better not git into any disputes
with him about your highway rights. Jist give him the
whole road and don’t argue with him. And be careful
you don’t hang around under the rim-rock when them
critters is around.”</p>

<p>“I take it they are animals,” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I guess they belong to the kingdom of
beasts,” replied Red. “Some people call ’em whang-doodles,
but they ain’t real whang-doodles, bein’ much
bigger and more ferocious. They’re purty scerce
now, but when we work the canyon <a id="chg2"></a>tomorrow, I can
show you places where they have been. Yes, sir, I can
show you the very spot where one of them fellers took
off one of the very best friends I ever had in this
world.”</p>

<p>“A sort of mountain lion, I suppose,” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“Son, one of them babies would make a mountain
lion look like a kitten. Besides, they don’t belong to
the feline species nohow, bein’ more like a kangaroo
in build, and about sixteen hands high when on all-fours,
though most of the time they hop along on their
hind legs and tail and keep their forepaws ready to
biff anything that gits in their way. And if one of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
critters hits you—well, you’re lucky if they find anything
to bury.</p>

<p>“However, that ain’t their main method of combat;
that ain’t the way one of ’em took off my dear friend—Jack
Snodgrass was his name. The glyptodont has got
a big flat tail made out of stuff like cow’s horn, except
there ain’t no bone in it. This tail bein’ springy is a
great aid and help in more ways than one. He can
jump along with it and clear the brush, and he can land
on it when he wants to jump off of a cliff, and he don’t
feel no bad effects from the jar.</p>

<p>“Well, I started to tell you how one of them beasts
took off my dear friend Jack Snodgrass. Jack used
to work on this outfit, and one fall he was workin’ the
canyon, jist like we’ll be tomorrow, and Jack gits a
glimpse of the glyptodont. Jack was always a curious
lad; so he tarried around to see what the critter was
about. Jack was on the other side of a canyon, anyway,
and he ’lowed he’d have plenty of time to make his
stampede if the critter showed any signs of combat. So
Jack jist looks across to see what’s goin’ on.</p>

<p>“Directly the glyptodont gits wind of him and looks
at him right straight for a minute or two. But Jack
still ain’t worried none, havin’ the canyon between him
and the ferocious beast. He jist stands there and
watches him to see what he is about. Purty soon he
notices that the glyptodont is spadin’ around on the
ground with his tail. Presently he scoops up a big
boulder, jist like you’d lift it with a shovel. He carries
this on his tail, bein’ careful not to let it fall off, and
backs up and eases it off on the top of a bigger boulder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
Jack begins to try to figure out a way to capture the
brute; he ’lows if he ever could git him broke, he’d
be a mighty handy animal to have around the place
about tankin’ time.</p>

<p>“Well, the glyptodont walks over to the other side
of the rock he’s set up and squats on his hind legs;
then he draws up his front legs and begins to whirl
around and around on his hind legs, jist like a spool
of barbed wire on a crowbar when you’re stringin’
fence. After he spins around a while, he lets down his
tail, which hits the rock he’s set up, which comes
through the air like a cannon-ball. That was the last
thing pore Jack ever knowed. We buried him, pore
feller, next day—that is, all of him we could find.
When we’re over there tomorrow, I’ll show you the
place where he got kilt, as well as a lot of other places
where them critters has catapulted rocks up and down
the canyons jist to keep in practice and for the fun of
seein’ ’em roll. Yeah, them club-tailed glyptodonts is
ferocious animals.”</p>

<p>“They’re vicious brutes,” agreed Joe, “but they ain’t
got much on the gwinter.”</p>

<p>“I never heard of a gwinter,” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Joe, “did you ever hear of a godaphro?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of a side-swiper?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of a mountain-stem-winder?”</p>

<p>“No, I never heard of them, either.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’re really all one and the same thing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
but the real true and correct name is gwinter.”</p>

<p>“And what sort of a beast is he?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a grass-eatin’ quadruped,” said Joe,
“something like a cross between a buffalo and a mountain-goat,
only he’s a lot more ferocious. The peculiar
thing about the gwinter is his legs. Instead of havin’
four legs of equal length like a critter ought to have,
or two short legs in front and two long ones behind,
like the glyptodont, these brutes have two long legs
on the downhill side and two short legs on the uphill
side. This is mighty convenient for ’em, since they
don’t live on level ground nohow. Some of ’em has
their right legs long, and some of ’em has their right
legs short, dependin’ on which way they graze around
the mountains. The Chisos and the Davis and the
Guadalupe mountains used to be full of ’em. Up there,
them critters was thicker than the buffalo or the antelope
on the plains, but they’re gittin’ mighty scerce now.
Still, they took off many a cow-hand in the early days,
and sometimes yet a tenderfoot gits in the way of one
of ’em and don’t come back home to the chuck wagon
at night.</p>

<p>“If one of them critters ever starts toward you,
Lanky, don’t for anything let him know you’re scered.
If you try to run, he’ll git you shore. Jest stand there
and look him right in the eye like you was glad to see
him. He’ll be comin’ right toward you with his head
down like a bat shot out of a cannon. Still, don’t move,
and if you’re in the saddle, hold your hoss. Jest let
that gwinter alone till he gits in two steps of you, then
take a couple of steps down the hill. He can’t run the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
other way, and you’ll be safe. Ten to one he’ll be so
mad about it he’ll try to foller you, anyway, and when
he gits his short legs down hill, he’s a goner. Jest stand
by and watch him roll down the mountain and break
his fool neck. That’s one reason why they’re so scerce,
the cowboys learned that trick. Another reason is that
they fought among themselves too much. You see,
them that has their long legs on the right used to meet
them that has their long legs on the left as they grazed
around the mountains. And when two of ’em met like
that, they always tangled up. Finally they fought till
the weaker side all got kilt, so now there’s only one
kind on each mountain. On some mountains it’s the
right-leggers, and on some mountains it’s the left-leggers.”</p>

<p>“If somebody would capture one alive,” said Lanky,
“he could sell him to a circus for five thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“That’s been tried, son; that’s been tried,” replied
Joe. “However, your figger’s too small. Once when I
was punchin’ cattle in the Chisos, Barnum and Bailey
sent a feller all the way down from New York City
with fifty thousand dollars to pay any man that would
cage him a gwinter. For a long time he couldn’t git
nobody to try it, till finally he come to our outfit.</p>

<p>“‘I won’t endanger the lives of my men in any sech
manner and fashion,’ says the boss. ‘However,’ he says,
turnin’ to us, ‘if any of you men want to try it on your
own hook, you can. They ain’t much work to do right
now, and I’ll let you off for a few days.’</p>

<p>“Well, we gits our best mounts and ropes, and looks
after our cinches, and sets out. We scouts around a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
while, and shore nuff we hears one snort right near the
foot of Egg-shell Mountain. We lets out our wildest
yells and fires off our six-shooters, and somehow, by
luck I guess, we gits the critter buffaloed, and he goes
tearin’ around the mountain and us after him. Each
time he goes around the mountain he gits a little higher.
We sees our hosses is goin’ to give out if we don’t
figger out some way to spell ’em. We ’lows that since
we got the critter on the run, two of us will be enough
to go around the mountain, and the others stays put.
Then on the next round, two more goes, and so on and
so forth. Each time we gits a bit nearer the top.
Finally, we all joins in, in order to be there when he
gits to the top and can’t go no further. And purty soon
there he is at the top.”</p>

<p>“How did he escape?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Why, the brute jest turned right through his self,
jest clean wrong side out like a sock, and run the other
way.”</p>

<p>“And that was the last you saw of him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we used to see him occasionally, as we knowed
by his long legs bein’ on the other side; but when
winter come, he caught cold and died. And that’s what
you’ll do, Lanky, if you set there by the coals and
shiver. You’d better git a little shut-eye before you
stand guard.”</p>

<h3>WIND AND WEATHER</h3>

<p>The day had been blustery enough, and Lanky’s eyes
were red from the sand’s having cut into his eyeballs.
There was still dust in the air, but at twilight the wind
had subsided, and Lanky was experiencing that feeling
of intense relief that comes when the sandstorm is over.</p>

<p>During the day there had been little talk. Lanky had
most of the time ridden within normal hailing distance
of Red Wallace; but conversation would have been
difficult, and neither he nor Red had been in the mood
for it. At noon each man swallowed his beans and
bacon as rapidly as he could. Even then, he consumed
a considerable quantity of sand.</p>

<p>The old-timers were sitting expectantly around the
fire. Their experience with tenderfeet told them that
Lanky would open the conversation, and that the topic
would be the wind.</p>

<p>“Terrible day we had,” he observed. “How much
sandstorm weather are we likely to have?”</p>

<p>“Son,” replied Red, “what you’ve seen today is the
gentle zephers of spring. You ain’t seen a real sandstorm.”</p>

<p>“Then,” replied Lanky, “I’d like to know how I’m to
know one when I meet it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you, Lanky,” said Red. “I’ll tell you
exactly how you can know. Do you recollect seein’
a log-chain hangin’ suspended from the big hackberry
tree in front of the bunkhouse?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“That immense chain?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” said Red. “That’s a log-chain. And you
wondered what it was up there for, no doubt. Well, it’s
to tell when there’s a sandstorm. As long as it’s
hangin’ straight down, we know there ain’t no wind to
speak of. When it hangs out at an angle of forty-five
degrees, we speak of a slight breeze. It’s only when
she’s stickin’ straight out parallel to the ground that
it’s correct and proper to speak of a windstorm.”</p>

<p>“I’d think winds like that would blow all the houses
and windmills over,” observed Lanky.</p>

<p>“It ain’t only the houses and windmills,” said Hank.
“It’s real-estate. Why, there was a feller come in here
one time and filed on a section of land in Colonel
Slaughter’s pasture, and a big sandstorm come along,
and he never did find that section. He advertised in all
the papers for it, offerin’ a reward for its return, and
he got lots of answers from people down in the brush
country that had stray sections on their hands that
they wanted to git rid of, but he looked ’em over and
said none of ’em had his brand on ’em. And so he had
to go back East.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, the wind does some mighty funny things,”
said Joe. “I come dang near losin’ the best saddle hoss
I ever had on account of a sandstorm.”</p>

<p>“I guess he got against a drift fence where the
tumbleweeds and sand collected and buried the critter
alive,” said Hank.</p>

<p>“Naw, that wasn’t it,” replied Joe, “though I’ve dug
many a cow-brute out of the sand drifts. It wasn’t
that. In them days I was workin’ cattle out in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
Monahans country. One evenin’ the boss tells me to
swing up a little draw, sayin’ the wagon would be at
the head. Well, I got out of the draw jest at dark, and
I looked around, but I couldn’t see no campfire anywheres
in sight. I rode around a while, but still not
seein’ no signs of the wagon, and bein’ tired, I decided
to turn in. I was scered to turn my hoss loose,
(Brown Jug was his name) for fear he’d strike off
to the remuda and leave me there afoot. So I stakes him
to a little cottonwood bush on top of a mound. I knowed
better than to hobble the critter, for he was wise to
walkin’ off with the hobbles on. Well, when I got him
staked out, I took off the saddle, which I used for a
pillow, and the blanket, which I used for a bed, and
went to sleep.</p>

<p>“In the mornin’ when I woke up and looked around,
the scenery wasn’t exactly familiar. There was a big
cottonwood tree which I couldn’t remember seein’ the
night before, and I wondered how I come to miss it.
And I looked some more, and there wasn’t any Brown
Jug in sight anywheres. I thinks to myself, the critter
never played a dirty trick like that on me before, and
I ’lows he must be around somewheres. Shorely, I
says to myself, I ought to be able to find the bush
I tied him to. So I whistles three times, and then I
hears a weak nicker ’way up in the top of the tree, and
I looks up, and damn me if there wasn’t that pore
critter, with his tongue hangin’ out, dang nigh choked
to death.</p>

<p>“Then I seen what had happened, I’d tied the hoss
on top of a sand-dune. The wind had come up and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
sand had blowed away. What I calculated on bein’ a
bush was in fact a great big tree—so dang big in fact,
that the thirty-foot lariat wouldn’t let pore Brown Jug
more than half way to the ground. If I hadn’t woke
up jest when I did, the pore brute would of choked
to death shore.”</p>

<p>“How did you get him down?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was easy,” said Joe. “In them days I
always had my old six-gun by me, and I jest whipped
her out and put a bullet through the rope and let Brown
Jug down. The fall didn’t seem to hurt him none, and
after he blowed a little while, he was as pert as ever.</p>

<p>“However, the wind got up again in the middle of
the mornin’, and the only way I could keep the hoss
on the ground was to tie big rocks to the horn of the
saddle.”</p>

<p>“That shows you’ve got more sense than a prairie-dog,”
said Hank, “which surprises me. Many a time
on the South Plains durin’ a sandstorm, I’ve seen them
critters ten feet in the air, diggin’ with all their might,
tryin’ to git back in their holes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ve seen,” said Red, “and it was
the funniest sight I ever saw caused by a sandstorm.
One day in the spring the boss sent me out to pizen
prairie-dogs. He was one man I didn’t work for long;
he jist couldn’t stand to see a man not doin’ somethin’.
So when the wind would git bad and he didn’t want
to go out his self, he would send us out to ride fence
and pizen dogs and the like.</p>

<p>“Well, this time I rode over to where I knowed
there was a big town, and I rode up, and what do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
suppose I saw? The sand was all blowed away, and
there was them holes stickin’ forty feet in the air.
I never knowed before that time how crooked them
critters made their residences.”</p>

<p>“The wind’s purty hard on the rodents sometimes,”
said Hank. “I knowed a wind, however, that helped
out a pore human down on Sulphur Draw that was
about to starve. This feller had come in to farm, and
he raised a cribful of corn, but the ranchers wouldn’t
buy it because it wasn’t shelled, and wouldn’t go in a
morral. So the pore farmer was about to starve, and
his old lady and kids to boot.</p>

<p>“This feller was jest fresh from the sticks and didn’t
have much confidence in anybody, anyway, and he
’lowed the ranchers was waitin’ for a chance to steal
his corn. So he nailed up the crib door good and tight.
He noticed a knothole in one of the walls, but he saw
it was too little for an ear of corn to go through; so
he jest let that go.</p>

<p>“One day a wind come up, and the farmer and his
folks hid in the dugout like prairie-dogs, and the next
day the wind laid, and they crawled out and looked
around; and there was corn cobs scattered all alongside
the crib. The old man thought shore somebody had
stole his corn, but when he got the crib door open, he
saw it there all shelled as purty as if he’d done it
his self.</p>

<p>“He was a sort of ignorant and superstitious man,
and the next day when I happened by, he says to me
that the fairies had come and shelled his corn. Well,
I never did take no stock in fairies and the like, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
I knowed there must be a reasonable and sane explanation
somewheres. So I picked up one of the corn cobs
and stuck it in the knothole. It was jest a good tight
fit. Then I told the old man what must of happened.
The wind got up and would of blowed all his corn out
of the crib, but the knothole wasn’t big enough for an
ear to go through. Hence each ear got shelled, and all
the corn was left in the crib. It was jest as simple as
that. Perfectly natural. If them old fellers we read
about that believed in fairies and witches, and all that
crap, had jest of used their heads, they’d found out
that everything’s natural and simple enough. They
put me in mind of Mex’cans. But as I was about to
say, the old man sold his corn and got on purty well.”</p>

<p>“There was a farmer close to us one time,” said Joe,
“that lost his milk cows in a curious manner. He had
a little patch of pop-corn, and one hot day the cows
broke into the patch and started eatin’ it up. All of
a sudden that corn begun poppin’ and flyin’ every which
away.”</p>

<p>“Did the shooting grains kill the cows?” asked
Lanky.</p>

<p>“Naw,” said Joe. “When the fool critters saw all
that pop-corn flyin’ through the air, they thought it was
snow, and jest naturally froze to death.”</p>

<p>“Do you ever have tornadoes out here?” asked
Lanky.</p>

<p>“You mean cyclones?” asked Joe. “Well, yes, sometimes.
A queer thing happened to me one time up here
jest below the Caprock. We was goin’ up the trail, and
one evenin’ it was hot as blazes and sultry and still.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
The cattle was gittin’ nervous and we was all expectin’
hell to break loose any time. And shore nuff it did.
A cloud come up in the northwest and it thundered and
lightened, and then the storm struck us. Them steers
jest naturally histed their tails and left the country.
I was on a good hoss, but it was all I could do to stay
in sight of them cattle. My pony was givin’ me all he
had, and he wasn’t gainin’ on them steers none. Neither
was the other boys gittin’ close to ’em.</p>

<p>“D’rec’ly I looked back over my shoulder like, and
there was them clouds bilin’ and whirlin’ around in the
sky; then all at once a funnel drops down and takes
out after me. I started quirtin’ my hoss. I feel right
mean about it yet when I think about it, for he was
doin’ his best to ketch that herd, and he couldn’t do
no more.</p>

<p>“Well, the next thing I knowed I was up in the air
still in the saddle with my hoss under me, whirlin’
round and round like a top. That cyclone carried me
around in the air like that for a half an hour or more,
me scered all the time that it was goin’ to drop me.
But it didn’t. After a while it sets me down jest as
gentle as a mother with her baby.</p>

<p>“I looks up, and there’s the herd comin’ hell-bent for
election right toward me. I gits off my slicker and fires
off my six-shooter and turns them steers and gits ’em
to millin’. Purty soon the other boys rides up, and we
gits ’em quieted down, and the whole outfit has to set
up and sing to ’em all night.</p>

 <p class="caption">“Jist as I teched the crown a feller yelled out.”</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>“The next day we counted ’em out, and we hadn’t
lost a head; not a single cow-brute was missin’. If it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
hadn’t been for that cyclone, we’d been gathering cattle
for a week, and then likely we wouldn’t of found ’em
all.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way it is,” said Red. “Some winds is
good and some winds is bad, but I’d rather have sandstorms
and risk a cyclone once in a while than to have
mud in the rainy season like they have on the Black
Land divide.”</p>

<p>“We found lots of mud when we drove through
last fall,” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“You jist thought you found mud,” replied Red.
“You ought to have seen them flats before they begun
makin’ roads. When I first hit that country, they was
jist fencin’ off the lanes, and when I got a job, the
boss put me to ridin’ fence. One day I was ridin’ along
by the lane, and I looked over and there was a good,
brand-new Stetson hat layin’ on the top of a mud-hole.
I thinks to myself, ‘That’s a good hat, and I might as
well have it as the next feller.’ So I got down and got
a-holt of a fence-post to steady myself, and reached
out to git it. Jist as I teched the crown a feller yelled
out: ‘Hey, what you doin’ there?’ he says. Then I
noticed for the first time that there was a man’s head
stickin’ out of the mud. I asked the feller if he needed
any help, but he said he was ridin’ a mighty good hoss,
and he guessed he’d make it through all right. He
afterwards got to be a mighty good friend of mine.
Pete Jackson was his name.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said Joe, “speakin’ of mud, that puts
me in mind of one experience I had goin’ up the trail
in ’83. We was kinda late in gittin’ through, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
rainy weather had already set in before we crossed the
Black Land divide. We hadn’t hardly got across when
we begun to notice that our hosses was losin’ all their
pertness. The boss’s pet cow-hoss got as lazy as a
jackass. My own favorite hoss, Brown Jug, jest got
sleepier and sleepier, till finally he jest laid down and
went to sleep and never did wake up. We lost half of
our remuda jest like that.</p>

<p>“The boss was terribly worried because he didn’t
like the idea of trainin’ on foot, and besides he didn’t
know whether his hands would stay with him or not
if he didn’t have nothin’ for ’em to ride. Well, I
figured there must be a cause of hoss sickness jest as
there is for everything else. So I begins to take note.
I notices that all the sick hosses has mud-balls on their
tails. Then I guesses what must be the matter. The
weight of the mud on the critters’ tails was makin’
sech a pull on the brutes’ hides that they jest couldn’t
shet their eyes. And I figured that bein’ unable to shet
their eyes, they was jest naturally dyin’ for sleep. I tells
the boss, and we cuts off the balls of mud. As soon
as we would cut one off, the critter would fall into a
deep sleep, jest like Adam in the Bible. Some of the
worst ones slept steady for four days and nights, and
then woke up fresh and pert as ever.”</p>

<p>“Still,” said Red, “it ain’t the mud and it ain’t the
wind that makes Texas weather bad; it’s the sudden
and quick changes.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Hank; “that’s right, as our new
boss found out once. He ’lowed he was goin’ to keep
a record of the weather. So he comes home with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
brand-new thermometer and hangs it up on the front
porch, and calls us boys to look at it. Well, sir, while
we was standin’ there the mercury runs up to about
ninety or a hundred to git a good start. Then all of a
sudden, down she goes with sech a jar that she jest
naturally knocks the bottom right out of the tube and
ruins the boss’s new thingamabob. Good instrument
it was too; not jest a mercantile advertisement, but
a good one that he had bought and paid money for.</p>

<p>“But that didn’t faze that man none. He sent off
back East somewheres and had one made to order with
a rubber cushion in the bottom of the tube to take up
the jar when the mercury fell. He got a patent on the
idear and got rich. His thermometers are in use all
over the Southwest. They’re the only kind that’ll stand
the climate.</p>

<p>“This feller was jest crazy about his new thermometer.
He was always lookin’ to see how cold it was
or how hot it was. Once a norther come up in the
night, and he jest had to git up and go look at his
instrument. He struck a match so he could see, and the
match jest froze, and he had to build a fire and warm
it up before he could blow it out.”</p>

<p>“That might sound a bit windy to a feller that didn’t
know the country,” said Joe, “but it’s probably so.
I seen sunshine freeze right on the streets of Amarillo
one time. Durin’ one of the long cold spells they had
up there, all the chickens died for want of sleep. You
see, they couldn’t tell when it was night, and the sunshine
stayed froze so long they jest naturally died.”</p>

<p>“Speakin’ of things freezin’,” said Red, “I’ve seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
words freeze. Once we was out in a blizzard cuttin’
drift fences, and tryin’ to point the herds to the canyons.
And we’d yell and cuss the critters, but we
couldn’t even hear ourselves. Well, sir, we finally got
the brutes into the brakes and was on our way back
when it started moderatin’. All of a sudden we heard
the dangest mess of yellin’ and cussin’ and cow-bawlin’
that you ever heard tell of. Presently we recognized
the very words we had spoke on the way down.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said Lanky, “that I learned a story
something like that from Addison and Steele.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless,” said Red, “doubtless you did. This that
I was tellin’ about happened right over here on Addison
and Steele’s outfit. I was workin’ for ’em at the
time.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” said Hank, “them northers come mighty
sudden at times. One time Bill Anker and me rides
up to a tank, and the day’s so warm and purty we
decides to go in swimmin’. We was jest ready to strip
off, when all of a sudden we notices the bullfrogs all
along the dam jumpin’ out of the willows like bats shot
out of a cannon. They hit the water all right and went
under, but them critters got fooled that time. They
poked out their heads like they always do; and there
they was froze tight as a hat-band in the ice. All along
the side of the tank for about ten feet from the dam,
the ice was jest naturally speckled with frog heads.”</p>

<p>“That puts me in mind,” said Joe, “of a tale Bill
Bishop used to tell. Bill said one time he started in
swimmin’ and dove off of a high bluff into a deep hole
of water. But jest as he was leavin’ the bluff, a drought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
come and dried up all the water. Bill thought shore
he’d kill his self on the rock bottom of the creek-bed,
but down comes a rise from a rain up above and fills
up the hole jest in time to save him.”</p>

<p>“Lucky,” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Joe, “I guess he was, yet not so powerful
lucky, after all. Jest as he was stickin’ up his head, it
got froze in the ice like them frogs Hank was tellin’
you about, and he had to stay there all day before the
boys come and chopped him out. Leastwise that’s what
he used to tell, but he was sech a damn windy that
you never knowed when he was tellin’ the truth and
when he was tryin’ to load somebody.”</p>

<h3 class="x-ebookmaker-important">BY THE BREADTH OF A HAIR</h3>

<p>Lanky had become intensely interested in the narratives
of Joe and his apprentices. He was happy that
he had been assigned to the same guard. All during
the day he had been trying to think of the most
pregnant question to put when the day’s work should
be over, and he should again sit with the windy trio
around the campfire. He thought of one that he felt
sure would elicit an interesting yarn.</p>

<p>“What,” he asked Joe, “was the narrowest escape
you ever had?”</p>

<p>Joe pulled out a shuck. He reached leisurely the sack
of Bull Durham in his vest pocket. He rolled the
cigarette with deliberation. He was not going to play
the fool by committing himself in any superlative way
until he had heard from his upstart rivals, young men
trying to usurp the arts and prerogatives universally
recognized as belonging to the old.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “that would be hard to say, hard
to say. When a man knocks around as much as I have,
and in the days when the West was wild, too, he’s
bound to of had many a close call, what with Mex’cans,
rustlers, bad men, stampedes, blizzards, and the like.
However, one of the worst sceres I ever had was once
when I got caught in a buffalo stampede. I reckon you
know somethin’ about the buffalo?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lanky, “I’ve read a little bit about
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Joe, “I can’t say as I’ve read very much
about ’em. I seen the plains black with ’em. And I’ve
killed a many a one in my day, too.</p>

<p>“Well, I started out to tell you what a close shave
I had one time at Buffalo Gap. I was a fool young
buck then, and one mornin’ in the spring after I first
hit that country, I heard a great roarin’ and bellowin’,
and I listened a while, wonderin’ what it was. Then
I says to myself, ‘I bet that’s a buffalo herd;’ for
I had heard the old-timers tell about ’em, and how they
come through the pass called Buffalo Gap every spring,
goin’ north.</p>

<p>“I rides up on one of the hills that overlooks the Gap
so as I could look right down on the beasts as they
come by. There I stops to see ’em pass. I didn’t git
there much too soon, for right away the whole pass was
choked with buffalo as thick as they could crowd;
jammed in closer than steers in a stock car.</p>

<p>“I was ridin’ a fool bronc, and he got to rearin’ and
pitchin’, and the first thing I knowed, we was rollin’
down the hill together. Well, the hoss turned three or
four cats in the air, and first he was on top and then
I was, but the critter lit feet down right on top of the
backs of them buffalo; and I was still in the saddle and
didn’t have no bones broke. Don’t ask me whether
I pulled leather or not, Lanky; don’t ask me that.</p>

<p>“Well, them brutes begun to run, and the first thing
I knowed they was in a regular stampede. I seen what
was happenin’. They was carryin’ me and that hoss
north jest as fast as they could run, which was purty
fast. Yes, sir, purty fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“I reins the hoss around and turns him south and
digs his sides with the rowels; and he runs toward the
south jest as fast as he could—and he was a right pert
pony, too.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I rides and I rides, all the time keepin’
my eye peeled for the tail-end of the herd. But I sees
nothin’ but buffalo, miles and miles of ’em.</p>

<p>“It was about the middle of the mornin’ when my
hoss fell off with me like that, and an hour by sun
I was still ridin’ all the time looking for the end of the
herd and thinkin’ it shorely would come some time.
I happened to look to the side, and what do you think
I seen, Lanky? What do you think I seen?”</p>

<p>“Help coming, I suppose,” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“No sech luck,” said Joe; “no sech luck. It was the
bushes we broke and the rocks we turned over when
me and that hoss rolled down the hill.</p>

<p>“Well, I rides another half hour, I guess, and I
begins to feel the hoss quiver and shake under me, and
I knowed the jig was about up. When a hoss does that
way, Lanky, he’s about ready to drop dead, and I
knowed that might happen any time.</p>

<p>“Purty soon I sees an openin’, and jest as that pony
jumped off the rump of the last buffalo, damn me if he
didn’t drop in his tracks, dead as a hammer. I knowed
that was goin’ to happen when I felt him quiver.</p>

<p>“Well, I climbed out on the hill afoot, forgittin’ to
git my saddle; and damn lucky it was I forgot, too;
for as soon as I got to the top of the hill and set down
on a rock to rest, I looked back, and there was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
main herd comin’ into sight, roarin’ and bellowin’ like
a cyclone.</p>

<p>“I had to walk back to my outfit; and several days
later, I rode back to the pass, but all I found of that
hoss and saddle was a little greasy spot on the ground.”</p>

<p>“That was a narrow escape,” said Lanky. “I suspect
you have had as many close calls as anybody.”</p>

<p>“Well, I couldn’t say about that,” said Joe. “But
I know that if that hoss had give out ten minutes
sooner, Joe Martin wouldn’t be settin’ here talkin’ to
you tonight.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” said Hank. “Joe always was a lucky cuss.
If he was to fall in a sewer, he’d come out with a lily
in each hand. Now, me, I was born too late. Land all
took up, buffalo all gone; no more trail drivin’ up
north. Still, what with reptiles and beasts and Mexico
steers and buckin’ hosses, and the like, I’ve had my
share of close calls.</p>

<p>“Funny how some little thing you don’t expect jest
as like as not comes along and takes you off.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ ain’t got you yet, Hank,” said Red.
“You’re here, ain’t you? What you kickin’ about?”</p>

<p>“I was jest thinkin’ how near I come to bein’ kilt
once. And if it hadn’t of been for Zac Weber, I would
of been.</p>

<p>“That lad could handle a six-gun, I can tell you.
I’ve seen him knock down six flyin’ quail with his old
Colt forty-five, ridin’ at a high run. He could turn six
pigeons loose at one time and knock ’em every one
down before they could git away. When he went duck
huntin’ he never packed anything but his old six-shooter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Some of the boys had shot-guns, but Zac said
his conscience never would git over it if he turned one
of them murderous implements loose on a pore helpless
fowl. And he never shot a duck on the water, either.
Not Zac. Mighty glad I was that he could shoot like
that, too, for he saved my life.”</p>

<p>“Bandit trouble?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Naw, worse,” said Hank, “though I could tell you
something about Glen Springs, but that’s not the time
Zac saved my life.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen a centipede, Lanky?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Lanky; “I don’t suppose I have.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you what they look like so as you’ll
know ’em. And don’t ketch ’em for playthings, Lanky,
don’t ketch ’em for playthings. Jest as well pet a rattlesnake.
They’re flat yeller worms with a hundred legs,
like fringe on each side, and on every foot there’s
a little hook that the centipede can hook into things that
he walks on. And them hooks is so pizenous that if he
walks across your skin while he’s mad, your flesh
will putrefy, and you’ll go as crazy as a locoed hoss,
and like as not take to the bushes like a jackrabbit
unless somebody holds you. That’s how pizenous
they are.</p>

<p>“Well, what I started out to tell you was, one time
at dinner me and Zac was settin’ on the ground about
fifty feet apart facin’ each other eatin’ our beans and
sow-belly. All at once I got a glimpse of somethin’ like
a yellow streak runnin’ up my vest on my bandanner,
but I jest barely did git a glimpse and couldn’t tell
what it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“‘Is there somethin’ on my neck?’ I says to Zac.</p>

<p>“‘Good God, man!’ says Zac. ‘It’s a centipede!’</p>

<p>“Well, we’d took off our gloves to eat, and I knowed
if I tried to knock the critter off, I’d jest <a id="chg3"></a>make him
mad, and he’d git me shore. And I knowed if Zac
come over to knock him off with a stick or somethin’,
he’d be dead certain to chase him off on my neck.</p>

<p>“‘Let him alone,’ I says, ‘and maybe he’ll crawl off
after while.’</p>

<p>“‘Jest be still,’ says Zac. And he whips out his old
six-shooter, and I hears the bullet whistle by my ear.</p>

<p>“‘I got him,’ says Zac.</p>

<p>“And I takes off my bandanner, and there is jest
a little speck where the bullet had jest barely teched
it. I always did feel grateful to Zac after that, for he
shore did save my life that day.”</p>

<p>“You think, then, that if the centipede had touched
your skin, he would really have killed you?” asked
Lanky.</p>

<p>“I don’t think nothin’ about it,” said Hank. “I know
it. Why, I tell you what happened. You see, Zac didn’t
have time to look what was on the other side of me
when he shot, but jest as he pulled the trigger, he
noticed an old cow-brute standin’ about fifty yards
off chewin’ his cud. Well, this old steer jumped, so Zac
said he must of hit him. Still we couldn’t see no wound
on him. We roped him and looked at the critter close
and found a bullet hole in his dew-lap.”</p>

<p>“In his what?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Why, in his dew-lap,” said Hank. “That’s the
grissle thing that hangs down from the neck of a cow-brute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
jest where it joins on to the breast. They used
to vaccinate for the black-leg by makin’ a hole in it.
We knowed the steer couldn’t be hurt much there; so
we turns him loose, and he gits up, and starts off.</p>

<p>“He hadn’t gone more than twenty steps, when his
neck was all swole up, big as a saddle-hoss. Then he
begin to rave and charge and beller so pitifully that we
jest shot him to git him out of his misery.</p>

<p>“That’s how pizenous them centipedes are. When I
saw that pore brute all swole up and out of his head
with torment, I knowed what a close call I’d had.”</p>

<p>Lanky’s attention had been divided between Red
and the narrator. He had glanced several times at Joe
also, who was sitting complacent, but not contemptuous,
listening with the respect due a good liar even
though a comparatively inexperienced one. But Red,
during the first part of Hank’s narrative had been in
a deep study. He rolled several cigarettes, only to throw
them away after taking a puff or two. He appeared
to listen; yet it was obvious that the narrator did not
have his full attention. Near the climax to Hank’s tale,
however, his countenance brightened up, and from that
time he sat quietly as one having an ace in the hole.
When Hank finished, he was ready.</p>

<p>“I didn’t have no crack shot, nor no friend of no
kind to help me out once when I come near passin’ in
my checks out in the Glass Mountains.</p>

<p>“I never did know what was the matter with that
fool hoss I was ridin’. He’d always been a mighty
sensible animal—fine cow-pony, quarter hoss, single-footer,
and the best night hoss on the outfit. I’d rode<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
him hard that day, and I thought maybe he was tired
of life and took a sudden notion to kill his self like an
English feller that come to our outfit and stayed a
while once. Then, again, I thought he might of went
blind all at once. I never could figger it out. Anyway,
he never acted like that before.”</p>

<p>“What did he do?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“What did he do? He done a plenty. Still I don’t
blame him, pore brute. There must have been somethin’
the matter.</p>

<p>“You see, I was ridin’ back to the headquarters on
a dark night. I was about half asleep, for I knowed
that old Frijole—that was his name—would find the
way. He always could. Well, I was ridin’ along that
way, when all of a sudden I finds us both fallin’ down
through empty space. Seemed like we never would hit
the ground, and before we got bottom, I figgered out
what had happened.</p>

<p>“Out in the edge of the Glass Mountains there was
a big sink-hole right out on the mesa. It was as big
across as a house, and six lariats deep right straight
down—we afterwards measured it—and Frijole had
loped off into that dang hole with me, and there we
was makin’ for the bottom.</p>

<p>“I thinks to myself, ‘This is where you pass in your
checks, Red. Some gits it early and some gits it late,
but they all gits it.’ Then we hits bottom.</p>

<p>“I guess I was shook up purty bad, for I woke up
after while, and there I was settin’ on a dead hoss. You
see, Frijole had broke his neck landin’, pore feller.
I always will wonder what was a eatin’ on him to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
him lope off into a hole like that. Must of been
somethin’.</p>

<p>“Well, I seen there wasn’t nothin’ I could do but
wait for daylight and then try to figure out some way
to git out; so I jist laid down and took a nap till
mornin’.</p>

<p>“When daylight come, I got up and looked around,
but the walls was straight up and down, and there
wasn’t nothin’ I could git a-holt of to climb out. Then
I took the rope off my saddle and begun to look for
somethin’ twenty feet or so up that I could rope,
thinkin’ I could pull myself up that far, and then
maybe rope somethin’ else a little higher up, and pull
myself up again, and so on till I was out.</p>

<p>“But there wasn’t a thing, Lanky, not a bush nor
a rock, nor nothin’ stickin’ out I could git a loop on.
Everything as slick as glass. ‘Well, maybe the boys
will come and hunt me,’ I thinks, ‘but how in the hell
will they know to look down in here?’</p>

<p>“I waited all day, and not a soul come: and I waited
all the next day, and still nobody come. The third day
I was still there and no better off than I was in the
beginnin’.</p>

<p>“By that time I was wishin’ I was dead, for I had
drunk up all the water in my saddle canteen, and I was
gittin’ hungry, too.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you have eaten some of the horse meat?”
asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess I could of,” said Red, “but at first I
wouldn’t out of friendship for the brute—for even if
he did git me in there, I always figgered there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
somethin’ wrong; he went out of his head or somethin’—and
after I got hungry enough to of et him, anyway,
his carcass had spoiled and was stinkin’ somethin’
terrible. That’s principally what made it so bad. Every
breath I drawed was misery.</p>

<p>“Finally I says, ‘Red, you can’t stand this no longer.
You’d shoot a pore dumb brute if you saw him in
torment like this.’ And so I cocks my six-shooter and
holds it to my head, but somehow I can’t pull the
trigger. ‘Stand it a little while longer,’ I says to myself,
‘and if help don’t come, shoot.’ I done that three
or four times, I guess.</p>

<p>“After a while buzzards begun flyin’ over the hole—dozens
of ’em sailin’ round and round. They knowed
there was somethin’ dead somewheres around, but they
was havin’ trouble locatin’ it. They kept comin’ lower
and lower, till directly one comes down into the sink-hole.
Then some more come, and they would fly right
down close to me. ‘I reckon you come after Frijole,’ I
says, ‘but jist wait a little while and you can have me
too.’</p>

<p>“And jist then I had an idear. I picks up my lariat
right quiet-like and begins unravelin’ it into little
strands. In each little strand I tied a noose. Then I takes
my seat by the side of the carcass and jist waits.
Directly a big turkey buzzard comes right down close,
and I throws a loop over his head and fetches him
down. Then I stakes him to my belt, givin’ him about
six foot of rope. After a while I gits another one.
I keeps on until I gits twenty of the vultures staked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
to my belt; then I fires off my six-shooter, scerin’ ’em
all at once.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, them birds jist naturally lifted me right
out of that sink-hole.”</p>

<p>“You were lucky,” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“Lucky! Lad, that wasn’t luck; that was head work.
You ain’t heard about my luck yet. Them buzzards
begun flyin’ away with me, but I seen what direction
they was goin’, and I jist let ’em alone and watched
the lay of the land. And when they had me right over
a big hay-stack at the headquarters of my own outfit,
I reached down and unbuckled my belt, and damn me,
if I didn’t land right on the hay without any hurtin’
a-tall.</p>

<p>“I walked up to the house and had a square meal—and
I et, too, I’ll tell you—and then I felt as fresh and
pert as ever.”</p>

<p>“That was a lucky landing,” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“It shore was,” said Red. “I got off light. The worst
thing about it was that them vultures carried off my
belt; and a cracker-jack it was, too, trimmed with
rattlesnake hide and gold studs. Twenty-eight dollars
and fifty cents it cost me over the counter at K. C.,
Misourey.”</p>

<p>Lanky expected Joe to tell the next story, but the
veteran smoked placidly, and graciously surrendered
his turn to Hank.</p>

<p>“A thing like that nearly happened to me once,” said
Hank, “except it was a canyon instead of a sink hole.</p>

<p>“I ought to of had more sense than to ride a fool
bronc like the critter I was on around a place like that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
but I was green in them days. You see I was ridin’
around a rimrock, lookin’ out for steers in the canyon
down below, and down below it was, shore-nuff—five
hundred feet straight down—jest as straight as a wall.</p>

<p>“Well, I’d rode along that way for a while, when
suddenly I took a fool notion to smoke. So I rolled
me a fat <i>tamale</i>, and pulled out a match and struck it
on my saddle-horn.</p>

<p>“Jest then that fool bronc bogged his head and
begun pitchin’ and bawlin’ like six-bits, and the next
thing I knowed he’d fell off that rim-rock. And it was
five hundred feet to the bottom if it was an inch. When
that hoss hit the bottom, he jest naturally spattered
all over the scenery.”</p>

<p>“And you?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” said Hank, “when we went off that
rim-rock together, I knowed that that saddle that I had
been tryin’ so hard to stay in was no place for me
then; so I got off; and I had to be damn quick about
it, too. I wasn’t much more than off the brute when
he hit the bottom.”</p>

<p>Lanky expected Joe to send him off to bed. There
were cattle to gather during the day and to hold at
night until all the pastures should be worked, and it
was Joe who usually reminded the unseasoned boy that
sleep was necessary, even if Lanky preferred the
romancing of the older hands.</p>

<p>But Joe merely chunked up the fire.</p>

<p>“That puts me in mind,” said he, “of a hunt I went
on once in the Guadalupe Mountains. You see, we was
out after big-horn sheep—used to be lots of ’em up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
there, but they are ’bout all gone now. Few up in the
mountains where the tin-horn hunters never go.</p>

<p>“I was follerin’ some of them critters around a ledge,
and presently I looked around and seen where I was.
The ledge was jest about a foot wide; and I looked
down, and there was a bluff right straight down for
five hundred feet, and I looked up, and there was a wall
five hundred feet straight up. There wasn’t no way to
git off that ledge but to go on or to turn back like I
come, and in some places the footin’ was mighty
ticklish, mighty ticklish.</p>

<p>“Well, I walked along till I come to a slick place,
and my foot slipped, and I had to let go my gun to
keep from fallin’. I shore hated to lose that thirty-thirty,
too, for we had been friends for years, and
many a deer and antelope and bear and panther I had
fetched down with it. But I jest naturally lost my
balance and had to let her go to save my neck.</p>

<p>“Well, not havin’ any gun, I thought I had jest as
well go back to the camp; so I started back like I come.
I goes around a little bend, and there comes a mountain
lion, a-creepin’ along towards me, jest like a cat tryin’
to slip up on a snow-bird.</p>

<p>“Says I, ‘Joe, this ain’t no place for you. I expect
you’d better go on the way you first started.’</p>

<p>“So I turns around and goes back around the bend.
When I gits about a hundred yards, there I sees a big
grizzly bear comin’ to meet me! and when he sees me,
he sets up and shows his teeth and growls.</p>

<p>“Says I, ‘Joe, maybe you’d better go back the other
way, after all.’ I thought maybe the cougar would be
gone. But as soon as I gits turned around—and I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
to be mighty careful in turnin’, for the ledge was
powerfully narrow—when I turns around, I sees the
big cat sneakin’ along toward me. And when I look the
other way, there comes the bear. And they are both
gittin’ closer and closer, and there I am, and it’s five
hundred feet straight down, and it’s five hundred feet
straight up.”</p>

<p>“How did you get off?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“How did I git off? Why, I couldn’t git off. They
got me, but whether it was the bear or the cougar, I
never did know.”</p>

<p>Joe finished with a flourish but without a smile.</p>

<p>He pulled out his watch. “Doggone,” he said, “I
never had no idear it was so late. We ought to of been
asleep before now. Lanky, you ought not to let these
boys keep you up so late. They’d talk you to death
if you’d jest set here and listen to ’em.”</p>

<h3>THE GENESIS OF PECOS BILL</h3>

<p>“I suppose,” said Lanky, as he sat by the camp-fire
with Red and Hank and Joe, now his fast friends,
“that the cowboy’s life is about the most interesting
one there is. I’d like it. Live outdoors, plenty of fresh
air to breathe, interesting work—that’s the life.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t kickin’,” said Joe. “You see I’m still at it,
though I’ve cussed it as much as anybody in my time,
and swore off and quit, too, more than once. But somehow
when spring comes, and the grass gits green, and
I know the calves is comin’, somethin’ jest naturally
gits under my hide, and I come back to the smell of
burnt hair and the creak of saddle-leather.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” said Red, “it’s jist like a dream I had once.
I dreamt I died and went up to a place where there was
big pearly gates, and I walked up and knocked on the
door, and it come wide open. I went in, and there stood
Saint Peter.</p>

<p>“‘Come in; welcome to our city,’ he says. ‘I’ve been
lookin’ for you. Go over to the commissary and git
you a harp and a pair of wings.’</p>

<p>“‘All right,’ says I, feelin’ mighty lucky to git in.</p>

<p>“As I walked along on the gold sidewalk, I sees
a lot of fellers roped and hobbled and hog-tied.</p>

<p>“‘What’s the matter?’ says I; ‘Saint Peter, you’re
not tryin’ to buffalo me, are you?’</p>

<p>“‘Naw,’ he says, ‘what makes you think so? Your
record ain’t nothin’ extra good, but you didn’t git cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
back, did you? Here you are. You’re in. Ain’t that
enough?’</p>

<p>“‘Ain’t this hell?’ I says.</p>

<p>“‘Naw’, says Peter, ‘this ain’t hell a-tall.’</p>

<p>“‘Are you shore this ain’t hell?’ I asks.</p>

<p>“‘Naw,’ he says, ‘this ain’t hell. What makes you
think it is?’</p>

<p>“‘Why,’ I says, ‘what you got all them fellers roped
and tied down for?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh,’ he says, ‘them fellers over there? You see
them’s cowboys from the Southwest, and I have to
keep ’em tied to keep ’em from goin’ back. I think
maybe they’ll git range broke after while so I can
turn ’em loose, but it seems like it’s takin’ a long
time.’”</p>

<p>“However,” said Joe, “the cow business ain’t what
it used to be, what with barbed wire, windmills, automobiles
and trucks, and the like. They don’t want cowhands
any more; what they want is blacksmiths,
mechanics, and the like. Still, I reckon it’s a good
thing, for they couldn’t git cowhands if they did want
’em.</p>

<p>“Now, here’s Red and Hank. Good boys, both of ’em.
And I’ve learned ’em a lot about cattle; and they take
money at the rodeos, but they ain’t like the old cowhands.
I don’t know jest what it is, but they ain’t
the same.</p>

<p>“And they ain’t but mighty few real cowmen any
more. Now, take the big mogul of this outfit. Good
feller, always pays wages every month—which is more
than some of the old-timers could do. But he ain’t no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
cowman. Sets up all day at a big desk in town—has
a secretary, stenographer, and the like. Why, if Pecos
Bill had a-done a thing like that, he would of been so
ashamed of his self, he would of jest naturally laid
down and died.”</p>

<p>“Who is this Pecos Bill I’ve heard you mention?”
asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Who is he? Why, ain’t you ever heard of Pecos
Bill?”</p>

<p>“Not till I came here.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, I reckon you’ve heard of Sam Houston,
and Sam Bass and General Lee and George Washington
and Pat Garrett, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ve heard a little about them but not anything
about Pecos Bill.”</p>

<p>“That jest shows that the fellers that make our
books don’t know what to put in ’em. The idear of
leavin’ out Pecos Bill.”</p>

<p>“But who was Pecos Bill?”</p>

<p>“Who was he? Why, he was jest about the most
celebrated man in the whole dang cow country.”</p>

<p>“What was his real name?”</p>

<p>“So far as I know the only real name he ever had
was Pecos Bill. Don’t suppose anybody knows what
his daddy’s name was. You see, in his day it wasn’t
good manners to ask a feller his name, and besides it
wasn’t good judgment either. And it ain’t been so long.
Many a greenhorn bein’ ignorant of that little point
of good manners has looked down the muzzle of a
six-shooter and then died.</p>

<p>“Pecos Bill’s daddy didn’t say what they called him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
back in the States, and nobody asked him. They jest
called him the Ole Man, for he was old—about seventy
some odd when he came to Texas.”</p>

<p>“When did he come to Texas?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say about that exactly,” said Joe. “It
must of been right about the time Sam Houston
discovered Texas. Anyhow, the Ole Man loaded up
all his twelve kids and his Ole Woman and his rifle,
and all his other stuff in an oxwagon and lit out hellbent
for Texas as soon as he found out there was sech
a place. They say other people that come later didn’t
have no trouble findin’ the way. They jest went by the
Indian skeletons that the Ole Man left along his road.</p>

<p>“Well, they finally got to the Sabine River. The
Ole Man stops his oxen, old Spot and Buck, he calls
’em, and rounds up all his younguns and has ’em set
down and listen while he makes ’em a speech. ‘Younguns,’
he says, ‘that land you see on the other side of
the river is Texas, wild and woolly and full of fleas.
And if you ain’t that way only more so, you ain’t no
brats of mine.’”</p>

<p>“I’d always heard that Pecos Bill was born in
Texas,” interrupted Red.</p>

<p>“Jest wait,” said Joe. “Jest wait; have I said he
wasn’t? Them was the other kids.</p>

<p>“As I was about to say, they crossed the river and
camped for the night. That was in Texas, savvy. And
that night Pecos Bill was born. The next mornin’ the
Ole Woman put him on a bear’s skin and left him to
play with his self while she made the corn-pone for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
breakfast. And right then’s when they come dang near
losin’ Pecos Bill.</p>

<p>“Bears or Indians?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Neither one,” said Joe. “Bears and Indians didn’t
mean nothin’ to that old man. He would have et ’em
for breakfast. Once later when the Ole Man and the
older brats was gone, the Comanches did try to git
Bill, but the Ole Woman lit into ’em with the broom-handle
and killed forty-nine right on the spot. She
never knowed how many she crippled and let git away.
No, it wasn’t the Indians. It was miskeeters.”</p>

<p>“Malaria?” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“You guessed wrong again,” said Joe. “This is what
happened. The Ole Woman was cookin’ corn-pone,
and all of a sudden it got dark, and there was the
dangest singin’ and hummin’ you ever heard. Then
they seen it was a swarm of big black miskeeters; and
they was so thick around Bill that you jest couldn’t
see him.</p>

<p>“The Ole Man felt his way to the wagon and got
out his gun. He thought he’d shoot it off in the air and
scere them miskeeters away. He pointed the muzzle
of the gun toward the sky and pulled the trigger. What
he seen then was a little beam of light come through. It
was jest like bein’ in a dark room and lookin’ out
through a piece of windmill pipe. That was jest for
a minute, for right away the hole shet up, and them
miskeeters swarmed around Pecos, and the Ole Man
seen they was goin’ to pack him off if he didn’t do
somethin’ right away.</p>

<p>“Then he happened to recollect that he’d brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
his hog-renderin’ kettle along; so he fought his way
back to the wagon and rolled it out and turned it over
the kid. He was scered the lad would git lonesome
under there by his self, so he jest slipped the choppin’
axe under the edge of the kettle for the chap to play
with.</p>

<p>“Well, them danged miskeeters jest buzzed and
buzzed around the kettle, tryin’ to find a way to git in.
D’rec’ly they all backed off, and the Old Man and the
Ole Woman thought they’d give up and was goin’
away. Then all at once one of them miskeeters comes
at that kettle like a bat out of hell. He hit the kettle
and rammed his bill clean through it; and he stuck
there. Then another one come at the kettle jest like
the first one had; and he stuck, too. Then they kept
comin’, and every one stuck. The Ole Man and the
Ole Woman and the older brats stood there watchin’
them miskeeters ram that kettle. After each one of
them varmints (they was too big to be called insects)
hit the kettle, there would be a little ring—<i>ding!</i> like
that. Purty soon the old folks got on to what was
happenin. Every time a miskeeter would ram his bill
through the kettle, Pecos would brad it with the
choppin’ axe. Well, after while them miskeeters jest
naturally lifted that kettle right up and flew off with
it. The others thought they had Pecos Bill and follered
the kettle off. Of course the Ole Man hated to lose his
utensil. He said he didn’t know how the Ole Woman
was goin’ to render up the lard and bear’s grease now;
but it was worth a hundred kettles to know he had
such a smart brat. And from that time the Ole Man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
would always talk about Bill as a chap of Great Possibilities.
He ’lowed that if the brat jest had the proper
raisin’, he’d make a great man some day. He said he
was goin’ to try to do his part by him; so he begun
givin’ him a diet of jerked game with whiskey and
onions for breakfast. He lapped it up so well that in
three days the Ole Woman weaned him.”</p>

<p>“Did the Ole Man settle there on the Sabine?” asked
Lanky.</p>

<p>“Naw,” said Joe. “He squatted on a little sandy hill
on the Trinity somewheres east of where Dallas is now.
It was jest an accident that he stopped where he did.”</p>

<p>“How was that?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Joe, “you see, it was like this. They
was travelin’ west in their customary and habitual
manner, which was with the Ole Man and the six
oldest kids walkin’ alongside Spot and Buck, and the
Ole Woman and the seven youngest kids in the wagon.
Jest as they was comin’ to the foot of a sandy hill, a big
rain come up. It rained so hard that the Ole Man
couldn’t see the wagon, but he stuck close to them
trusty oxen of his, and they went right up the hill.
When he got to the top, he seen that it had about quit
rainin’; and he looked back and seen the wagon still
at the bottom of the hill, and there was the brats that
had been walkin’ with him under it.”</p>

<p>“Did the harness break?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Naw, it wasn’t that,” said Joe. “You see, he was
usin’ a rawhide lariat for a log-chain, and it had got
wet. I reckon you know what rawhide does when it
gits wet, don’t you, Lanky? It stretches. There ain’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
no rubber that will stretch like wet rawhide. Well,
that’s what happened to that lariat. It stretched so that
the Ole Man drove his oxen a mile up the hill without
movin’ the wagon an inch. Not an inch had he moved
her, by gar.</p>

<p>“Well, the sun was shinin’ now, and it got brighter
and brighter, and while the Ole Man was wonderin’
what in the dickens to do next, Ole Spot jest dropped
down dead from sunstroke. That sort of got next to
the Ole Man, for he said that brute had been a real
friend to him, and besides he was worth his weight
in gold. Still, he ’lowed he’d might as well skin him.
So he got out his old Bowie knife and started to work.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, while he was skinnin’ Spot, a norther
came up, and damn me, if Ole Buck didn’t keel over,
froze to death.</p>

<p>“So the Ole Man decided he’d jest as well stop
there where he was. So he told the Ole Woman to
bring up the brats. He throwed the ox yoke over a
stump; and the Ole Woman brought up some chuck
and some beddin’ from the wagon. Then they et supper
and tucked the kids into bed. The Ole Man tried
to blow out the lantern, but she wouldn’t blow. He
raised up the globe, and there was the flame froze stiff
as an icicle. He jest broke it off and buried it in the
sand and turned in and went to sleep.</p>

<p>“The next mornin’ when he woke up, it was clear
and the sun was warm. Well, the Ole Woman cooked
a bite, and while they was eatin’, here come the wagon
right up the hill. You see the rawhide was dryin’ out.
That’s the way it does.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“That’s what it does, all right,” said Red. “Once I
knowed a clod-hopper that made his self a rawhide
hat. It worked fine till one day he got caught out in
the rain. Then the sun come out, and that hat drawed
up so he couldn’t git it off. And it was drawin’ up and
mashin’ his head somethin’ terrible. Lucky for him,
it wasn’t very far to a tank, and he got off and stood
on his head in the water a few minutes and it come
right off.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Joe, “that’s what the rawhide log-chain
done. It dried out, and that wagon come right up the
hill; and when it got up to where the Ole Man and the
Ole Woman was, the Ole Man got his choppin’ axe
and begun cuttin’ down trees to make him a cabin. And
that’s where he settled.”</p>

<p>“Did Pecos Bill grow up there in East Texas?”
asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“He left when he was a mere lad,” said Joe. “But
he lived there a little while. The Ole Man got along
fine till his corn give out, because there was plenty
of game. But he jest couldn’t do without his corn-pone
and his corn whiskey. So he cleared a little patch and
put it in corn.”</p>

<p>“And worked it without his steers?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Why not?” said Joe. “He made him a light
Georgie-stock out of wood, and the Ole Woman and
one of the bigger kids could pull it fine. He made some
harness out of the hide of Old Spot, and he’d hitch ’em
and plough all day.</p>

<p>“They used to all go out in the field and leave Pecos
Bill in the cabin by his self. One day when Bill was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
about three years old, the Ole Man was ploughin’ and
jest as he turned the Ole Woman and the kid he had
hitched up with her around to start a new row, the Ole
Woman begun yellin’ and tryin’ to get out of the
harness.</p>

<p>“‘What’s eatin’ on you, Ole Woman?’ says the Ole
Man. ‘I never seen you do like this before. Must have
a tick in your ear.’</p>

<p>“The Ole Woman yelled that she seen a panther go
in the cabin where Bill was.</p>

<p>“The Ole Man told her not to git excited. ‘It’s a
half hour by sun till dinner time yet,’ he says, ‘and that
dang panther needn’t expect no help from me nohow.
The fool critter ought to of had more sense than to go
in there. He’ll jest have to make out the best way he
can.’</p>

<p>“So they ploughed on till dinner time, and when they
come back to the cabin, there was Pecos Bill a-chewin’
on a piece of raw panther flank.</p>

<p>“They lived there another year or two before the
Ole Man taken a notion to leave.”</p>

<p>“I reckon you know how he come to git the idear
in his head, don’t you, Joe?” said Red.</p>

<p>“I’ll bite,” said Joe. “Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Why, this ain’t no sell,” said Red. “I’ve heard
Windy Williams tell it a hundred times.</p>

<p>“One time the Ole Man had the Ole Woman and
one of the big kids hitched up to the plough in his
customary and habitual manner, jist as Joe has been
tellin’ about, and all at once here comes a piece of
paper blowin’ across the field. The Ole Woman shied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
a little bit off to one side; then the kid got to prancin’,
and then they tore loose and went lickity-split, rearin’
and tearin’ across that corn patch, draggin’ the Ole
Man with ’em. The Ole Man stumped his toe on a root,
and then they got loose from him and tore up the
Georgie-stock. After while they quieted down, and the
Ole Man got up and fetched ’em in. Then he went out
and picked up the piece of paper where it was hung
on a stump. He seen it was an old newspaper. That set
him to wonderin’.</p>

<p>“The next mornin’ he got his rifle and begun lookin’
around. About five miles from his place he found some
wagon tracks, and he follered the tracks till he come
to a new cabin about fifty miles up the creek. Then
he come home and told the Ole Woman and the kids
to git ready to leave. He calkilated the country was
gittin’ too thickly settled for him.”</p>

<p>“How did he get away without a team?” asked
Lanky.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was easy,” said Red. “He sent Pecos Bill
out to ketch a couple of mustangs, and in about an
hour the lad run ’em down. The Ole Man fixed up the
harness he’d been usin’ to plough with, and loaded in
his stuff and his wife and kids, and pulled out.</p>

<p>“They kept goin’ west till finally they come to the
Pecos River, which the Ole Man said he’d ford or
bust. He got across all right, but as he was drivin’
up the bank on the west side, the end-gate come out
of the wagon, and Pecos Bill fell out. The Ole Man
and the Ole Woman never missed him till they got
about thirty miles further on; then they said it wasn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
worth while turnin’ back. They said they guessed the
chap could take kere of his self, and if he couldn’t he
wasn’t worth turnin’ back for nohow. So that’s how
Pecos Bill come to be called Pecos Bill.”</p>

<p>“What became of him?” asked Lanky. “What
happened to him then?”</p>

<p>“What happened to him then?” said Red. “That
would take a long time to tell.”</p>

<p>“We’ll tell you about that some other time, Lanky,”
said Joe.</p>

<h3>ADVENTURES OF PECOS BILL</h3>

<p>“How old was Pecos Bill when he was lost on the
Pecos River?” Lanky asked Joe on the next night when
supper was finished and the four were sitting around
the fire smoking.</p>

<p>“I guess he must of been about four year old,” said
Joe. “Some says he was jest a year old, but that can’t
be right. The Ole Man made two or three crops down
on the Trinity before the country got so thickly
settled that he had to leave.”</p>

<p>“What became of the family?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“That would be hard to answer,” said Joe; “hard
to answer. I don’t suppose there’s a soul that knows
for certain. There’s been tales about ’em bein’ et up
by wild beasts, but that ain’t likely; and there’s been
tales about ’em bein’ killed by the Indians, but that
ain’t likely neither. Why, them Red-Skins would run
like scered jack-rabbits when they seen the Ole Man
comin’, or the Ole Woman either. Then there’s tales
about ’em dyin’ for water in the desert, which may
be so; but more than likely they settled somewheres
and lived a happy and peaceful life.”</p>

<p>“The chances are,” said Red, “that they settled in
the Lost Canyon, and their offspring may be livin’
there yet for all anybody knows.”</p>

<p>“Where is the Lost Canyon?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“That’s jist what nobody don’t know,” said Red;
“but it’s out in the Big Bend Country somewheres, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
it opens into the Río Grande. It gits wide, and there’s
springs in it, and buffalo a-grazin’ on the grass, and
it’s a fine country.”</p>

<p>“How do you know about it?” asked Lanky. “Have
you ever been there?”</p>

<p>“Naw,” said Red, “but people has. But you never
can find it when you’re lookin’ for it. Them that finds
it, finds it accidentally, and then they can’t go back.
That’s jist the place that would of suited Pecos Bill’s
Ole Man, and the chances are that’s where he stopped.
Some day I’m goin’ to happen on that canyon myself,
and if I do, I’ll jist stake me out a ranch; that is unless
it’s inhabited by Pecos Bill’s race. If it is, I reckon
I’ll let ’em have it.”</p>

<p>“And what became of Pecos Bill?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Joe, “he jest growed up with the
country. There wasn’t nothin’ else he could do. He got
to runnin’ with a bunch of coyotes and took up with
’em. He learned their language and took up all their bad
habits. He could set on the ground and howl with the
best of ’em, and run down a jack-rabbit jest as quick,
too. He used to run ahead of the pack and pull down
a forty-eight point buck and bite a hole in his neck
before the rest of the coyotes got there. But he always
divided with the pack, and that’s probably the reason
they throwed off on him like they did.”</p>

<p>“Did he ever teach anybody else the coyote language?”
asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Jest one old prospector that befriended him once.
That was all. You see the old man couldn’t find no
gold and he went to trappin’, and he used the language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
that Bill had taught him to call up the coyotes and
git ’em in his traps. Bill said it was a dirty trick, and
he wouldn’t teach nobody else how to speak coyote.
Bill would of killed the old prospector if it hadn’t of
been that the old man done him a favor once.”</p>

<p>“What did he do?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Why, it was him that found Bill and brought him
back to civilization and liquor, which Bill had jest
about forgot the taste of.”</p>

<p>“How old was Bill at that time?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he was about ten years old,” said Joe.
“One day this old prospector comes along and he hears
the most terrible racket anybody ever heard of—rocks
a-rollin’ down the canyon, brush a-poppin’, and the
awfullest howlin’ and squallin’ you could imagine; and
he looks up the canyon and sees what he first thinks
is a cloud comin’ up, but purty soon he discovers it’s
fur a-flyin’.</p>

<p>“Well, he decides to walk up the canyon a piece and
investigate, and purty soon he comes on Pecos Bill,
who has a big grizzly bear under each arm jest mortally
squeezin’ the stuffin’ out of ’em. And while the old
prospector stands there a-watchin’, Bill tears off a hind
leg and begins eatin’ on it.</p>

<p>“‘A game scrap, son,’ says the old prospector, ‘and
who be ye?’</p>

<p>“‘Me?’ says Bill. ‘I’m a varmit.’</p>

<p>“‘Naw, ye ain’t a varmit,’ says the old prospector;
‘you’re a human.’</p>

<p>“‘Naw,’ says Bill, ‘I ain’t no human; I’m a varmit.’</p>

<p>“‘How come?’ says the prospector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“‘Don’t I go naked?’ says Bill.</p>

<p>“‘Shore ye do,’ says the old Prospector. ‘Shore ye’re
naked. So is the Indians, and them critters is part
human, anyway. That don’t spell nothin’.’</p>

<p>“‘Don’t I have fleas?’ says Bill.</p>

<p>“‘Shore ye do,’ says the old prospector, ‘but all
Texians has fleas.’</p>

<p>“‘Don’t I howl?’ says Bill.</p>

<p>“‘Yeah, ye howl all right,’ says the old prospector,
‘but nearly all Texians is howlin’ most of the time.
That don’t spell nothin’ neither.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, jest the same I’m a coyote,’ says Bill.</p>

<p>“‘Naw, ye ain’t a coyote,’ says the old prospector.
‘A coyote’s got a tail, ain’t he?’</p>

<p>“‘Yeah,’ says Bill, ‘a coyote’s got a tail.’</p>

<p>“‘But you ain’t got no tail,’ says the old prospector.
‘Jest feel and see if you have.’</p>

<p>“Bill felt and shore nuff, he didn’t have no tail.</p>

<p>“‘Well, I’ll be danged,’ he says. ‘I never did notice
that before. I guess I ain’t a coyote, after all. Show me
them humans, and if I like their looks, maybe I’ll throw
in with ’em.’</p>

<p>“Well, he showed Bill the way to an outfit, and it
wasn’t long till he was the most famous and noted man
in the whole cow country.”</p>

<p>“It was him,” said Hank, “that invented ropin’. He
had a rope that reached from the Río Grande to the
Big Bow, and he shore did swing a mean loop. He used
to amuse his self by throwin’ a little <i>Julian</i><span class="lock"><a id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span> up in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
sky and fetchin’ down the buzzards and eagles that flew
over. He roped everything he ever seen: bears and
wolves and panthers, elk and buffalo. The first time
he seen a train, he thought it was some kind of varmit,
and damn me if he didn’t sling a loop over it and
dang near wreck the thing.</p>

<p>“One time his ropin’ shore did come in handy, for
he saved the life of a very dear friend.”</p>

<p>“How was that?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Well, Bill had a hoss that he thought the world of,
and he had a good reason to, too, for he had raised
him from a colt, feedin’ him on a special diet of nitroglycerin
and barbed wire, which made him very tough
and also very ornery when anybody tried to handle him
but Bill. The hoss thought the world of Bill, but when
anybody else come around, it was all off. He had more
ways of pitchin’ than Carter had oats. Lots of men
tried to ride him, but only one man besides Bill ever
mounted that hoss and lived. That’s the reason Bill
named him Widow-Maker.”</p>

<p>“Who was that man?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“That was Bill’s friend that I was goin’ to tell you
about Bill savin’ his life,” said Hank. “You see this
feller gits his heart set on ridin’ Widow-Maker. Bill
tried to talk him out of it, but he wouldn’t listen. He
said he could ride anything that had hair. It had been
his ambition from youth, he said, to find a critter that
could make him pull leather. So Bill, seein’ the pore
feller’s heart was about to break, finally told him to
go ahead.</p>

 <p class="caption">“A-settin’ on that tornado and a-spurrin’ it in the withers.”</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>“He gits on Widow-Maker, and that hoss begins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
to go through his gaits, doin’ the end-to-end, the sunfish,
and the back-throw; and about that time the rider
goes up in the sky. Bill watches him through a spyglass
and sees him land on Pike’s Peak. No doubt he would
of starved to death up there, but Bill roped him by the
neck and drug him down, thus savin’ his life.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” said Red, “Widow-Maker was jist the sort
of hoss that suited Bill exactly. For one thing, it saved
him a lot of shootin’, because he didn’t have no trouble
keepin’ other people off his mount; and as for Bill,
he could ride anything that had hair and some things
that didn’t have. Once, jist for fun, he throwed a surcingle
on a streak of lightin’ and rode it over Pike’s
Peak.</p>

<p>“Another time he bet a Stetson hat he could ride
a cyclone. He went up on the Kansas line and simply
eared that tornado down and got on it. Down he come
across Oklahoma and the Panhandle a-settin’ on that
tornado, a-curlin’ his mustache and a-spurrin’ it in the
withers. Seein’ it couldn’t throw him, it jist naturally
rained out from under him, and that’s the way Bill
got the only spill he ever had.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” continued Red, “I reckon Bill was mighty
hard to throw. A smart lad he was, and a playful sort
of feller, too. In his spare time he used to amuse his
self puttin’ thorns on things—bushes and cactuses and
the like, and he even stuck horns on the toads so
they’d match up with the rest of the country.”</p>

<p>“I see he’s been at work in this country,” said
Lanky. “Did he live all his life in Texas?”</p>

<p>“Naw, he didn’t,” said Joe. “Bill was a good deal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
like his old man. When he had killed all the Indians
and bad men, and the country got all peaceful and quiet,
he jest couldn’t stand it any longer, and he saddled up
his hoss and started west. Out on the New Mexico
line he met an old trapper, and they got to talkin’, and
Bill told him why he was leavin’, and said if the old
man knowed where there was a tough outfit, he’d be
much obliged if he would tell him how to git to it.</p>

<p>“‘Ride up the draw about two hundred miles,’ says
the old <a id="chg4"></a>trapper, ‘and you’ll find a bunch of guys so tough
that they bite nails in two jest for the fun of it.’</p>

<p>“So Bill rides on in a hurry, gittin’ somewhat reckless
on account of wantin’ to git to that outfit and git
a look at the bad <i>hombres</i> that the old man has told
him about. The first thing Bill knowed, his hoss
stumps his toe on a mountain and breaks his fool neck
rollin’ down the side, and so Bill finds his self afoot.</p>

<p>“He takes off his saddle and goes walkin’ on,
packin’ it, till all at once he comes to a big rattlesnake.
He was twelve feet long and had fangs like the tushes
of a <i>javelina</i>; and he rears up and sings at Bill and
sticks out his tongue like he was lookin’ for a scrap.
There wasn’t nothin’ that Bill wouldn’t fight, and he
always fought fair; and jest to be shore that rattlesnake
had a fair show and couldn’t claim he took
advantage of him, Bill let him have three bites before
he begun. Then he jest naturally lit into that reptile
and mortally flailed the stuffin’ out of him. Bill was
always quick to forgive, though, and let by-gones be
by-gones, and when the snake give up, Bill took him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
up and curled him around his neck, and picked up his
saddle and outfit and went on his way.</p>

<p>“As he was goin’ along through a canyon, all at
once a big mountain lion jumped off of a cliff and
spraddled out all over Bill. Bill never got excited. He
jest took his time and laid down his saddle and his
snake, and then he turned loose on that cougar. Well,
sir, the hair flew so it rose up like a cloud and the jack-rabbits
and road-runners thought it was sundown. It
wasn’t long till that cougar had jest all he could stand,
and he begun to lick Bill’s hand and cry like a kitten.</p>

<p>“Well, Bill jest ears him down and slips his bridle
on his head, throws on the saddle and cinches her
tight, and mounts the beast. Well, that cat jest tears
out across the mountains and canyons with Bill on his
back a-spurrin’ him in the shoulders and quirtin’ him
down the flank with the rattlesnake.</p>

<p>“And that’s the way Bill rode into the camp of the
outfit the old trapper had told him about. When he gits
there, he reaches out and cheeks down the cougar and
sets him on his haunches and gits down and looks at
his saddle.</p>

<p>“There was them tough <i>hombres</i> a-settin’ around the
fire playin’ <i>monte</i>. There was a pot of coffee and a
bucket of beans a-boilin’ on the fire, and as Bill hadn’t
had nothin’ to eat for several days, he was hungry;
so he stuck his hand down in the bucket and grabbed
a handful of beans and crammed ’em into his mouth.
Then he grabbed the coffee pot and washed ’em down,
and wiped his mouth on a prickly-pear. Then he turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
to the men and said, ‘Who in the hell is boss around
here, anyway?’</p>

<p>“‘I was,’ says a big stout feller about seven feet
tall, ‘but you are now, stranger.’</p>

<p>“And that was the beginning of Bill’s outfit.”</p>

<p>“But it was only the beginnin’s,” said Red; “for it
wasn’t long after that that he staked out New Mexico
and fenced Arizona for a calf-pasture. He built a big
ranch-house and had a big yard around it. It was so
far from the yard gate to the front door, that he used
to keep a string of saddle hosses at stations along the
way, for the convenience of visitors. Bill always was
a hospitable sort of chap, and when company come, he
always tried to persuade them to stay as long as he
could git ’em to. Deputy sheriffs and brand inspectors
he never would let leave a-tall.</p>

<p>“One time his outfit was so big that he would have
his cooks jist dam up a draw to mix the biscuit dough
in. They would dump in the flour and the salt and the
bakin’-powder and mix it up with teams and fresnoes.
You can still see places where the dough was left in
the bottom of the draw when they moved on. Alkali
lakes they call ’em. That’s the bakin’-powder that
stayed in the ground.</p>

<p>“One time when there was a big drought and water
got scerce on Bill’s range, he lit in and dug the Río
Grande and ditched water from the Gulf of Mexico.
Old man Windy Williams was water boy on the job,
and he said Bill shore drove his men hard for a few
days till they got through, and it kept him busy
carryin’ water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>“I guess it took about all of Bill’s time to manage
a ranch like that,” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“Not all, not all,” said Joe. “That was his main
vocation and callin’, but he found time for a good
many other things. He was always goin’ in for somethin’
else when the cattle business got slack.</p>

<p>“When the S. P. come through, he got a contract
furnishin’ ’em wood. Bill went down into Mexico and
rounded up a bunch of greasers and put ’em to cuttin’
wood. He made a contract with ’em that they was to
git half the wood they cut. When the time was up, they
all had big stacks of cordwood, Mex’can cords, you
understand, that they don’t know what to do with.
So Bill talked it over with ’em and finally agreed to
take it off their hands without chargin’ ’em a cent.
Bill always was liberal.</p>

<p>“He done some of the gradin’ on the S. P. too. This
time he went out and rounded up ten thousand badgers
and put ’em to diggin’. He said they was better laborers
than Chinks, because he could learn ’em how to work
sooner. Bill had some trouble, however, gittin’ ’em to
go in a straight line, and that’s why the S. P. is so
crooked in places.</p>

<p>“He also got a contract fencin’ the right-of-way. The
first thing that he done was to go out on the line of
Texas and New Mexico and buy up all the dry holes
old Bob Sanford had made out there tryin’ to git
water. He pulled ’em up and sawed ’em up into two-foot
lengths for post-holes.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that Paul Bunyan did that with dry oil-wells,”
said Lanky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“Paul Bunyan might of for all I know,” said Joe.
“But if he did, he learned the trick from Pecos Bill,
for this was before oil had been invented.</p>

<p>“However, it cost so much to freight the holes
down that Bill give up the plan long before he had
used up all of Bob Sanford’s wells, and found a
cheaper and better way of makin’ post-holes.”</p>

<p>“What was his new method?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Why, he jest went out and rounded up a big bunch
of prairie-dogs, and turned ’em loose where he wanted
the fence, and of course every critter of ’em begun
diggin’ a hole, for it’s jest a prairie-dog’s nature to dig
holes. As soon as a prairie-dog would git down about
two feet, Bill would yank him out and stick a post in
the hole. Then the fool prairie-dog would go start
another one, and Bill would git it. Bill said he found
the prairie-dog labor very satisfactory. The only
trouble was that sometimes durin’ off hours, the
badgers that he had gradin’ would make a raid on the
prairie-dogs, and Bill would have to git up and drive
’em back to their own camp.”</p>

<p>“Did Bill have any other occupations?” asked
Lanky.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Joe, “he used to fight Indians jest for
recreation, but he never did make a business of it like
some did, huntin’ ’em for a dollar a scalp. In fact Bill
was not bloodthirsty and cruel, and he never scalped
an Indian in his life. He’d jest skin ’em and tan their
hides.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” said Hank, “of another business
he used to carry on as a sort of side-line, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
was huntin’ buffalo. You see, it was the hides that was
valuable, and Bill thought it was too much of a waste
to kill a buffalo jest for the hide; so he’d jest hold
the critters and skin ’em alive and then turn ’em aloose
to grow a new hide. A profitable business he built up,
too, but he jest made one mistake.”</p>

<p>“What was that?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“One spring he skinned too early, and a norther
come up, and all the buffalo took cold and died. Mighty
few of ’em left after that.”</p>

<p>“Did Bill ever get married?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Joe. “He married lots of women in
his day, but he never had the real tender affection for
any of the rest of ’em that he had for his first wife,
Slue-Foot Sue.</p>

<p>“Bill savvied courtin’ the ladies all right; yet he
never took much stock in petticoats till he met Slue-Foot
Sue; but when he saw that gal come ridin’ down
the Río Grande on a catfish, it jest got next to him,
and he married her right off.</p>

<p>“I say right off—but she made him wait a few days
till she could send to San Antonio for a suitable and
proper outfit, the principal garment bein’ a big steel
wire bustle, like all the women wore when they dressed
up in them days.</p>

<p>“Well, everything would have gone off fine, but on
the very day of the weddin’ Sue took a fool notion into
her head that she jest had to ride Widow-Maker. For
a long time Bill wouldn’t hear to it, but finally she
begun to cry, and said Bill didn’t love her any more.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
Bill jest couldn’t stand to see her cry; so he told her
to go ahead but to be keerful.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>“Well, she got on that hoss, and he give about two
jumps, and she left the saddle. He throwed her so
high that she had to duck as she went up to keep from
bumpin’ her head on the moon. Then she come down,
landin’ right on that steel bustle, and that made her
bounce up jest as high, nearly, as she had went before.
Well, she jest kept on bouncin’ like that for ten days
and nights, and finally Bill had to shoot her to keep
her from starvin’ to death. It nearly broke his heart.
That was the only time Bill had ever been known to
shed tears, and he was so tore up that he wouldn’t have
nothin’ to do with a woman for two weeks.”</p>

<h3>THE EXODUS OF PECOS BILL</h3>

<p>Lanky had been sent for, and this was his last night
in camp. His face was tanned; he had gained in weight;
he had earned money in his own right. He felt that he
was now a man.</p>

<p>He and his cronies sat around the fire in silence. Joe
and the boys would miss the kid, and he hated to leave.
This silence wouldn’t do.</p>

<p>“What became of Pecos Bill?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“That would be hard to say,” said Joe, “hard to say.
Everybody knows he’s gone, jest like the open range
and the longhorn steer; but jest how and where he
passed in his checks, I don’t suppose anybody will ever
find out for certain. A lot of the fellers that knowed
him are dead, and a lot of ’em has bad memories—a
lot of the old-timers has bad memories—and some of
’em are sech damn liars that you can’t go by what
they say.”</p>

<p>“You’ve seen Pecos Bill, haven’t you, Joe?” said
Lanky.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, that is I seen him when I was a young
buck. But I never seen him die, and I never could find
out jest how he was took off. I’ve seen some mighty hot
arguments on the subject, and I’ve knowed one or two
fellers to die with their boots on after gittin’ in a
quarrel in jest that way.”</p>

<p>“I heard one account a few years ago,” said Red,
“that may be right. There was a feller in Amarillo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
named Gabriel Asbury Jackson. He’d worked his self
out of a job in Kansas and had come to Texas to buck
the cigarette evil. One time he cornered a bunch of us
that was too drunk to make a git-away and begun
talkin’ to us about smokin’.</p>

<p>“‘Young men,’ he says, ‘beware of cigarettes. You
think you’re smart to smoke a sack of Bull Durham
every day, do you? Well, look at Pecos Bill. A stalwart
young man he was, tough as nails, a fine specimen.
But he got to foolin’ with cigarettes. What did they
do for him?’ he says. ‘Why, nothin’ at first. But did
he quit? No!’ he says. ‘He puffed away for ninety
years, but they finally got him. And they’ll git you,
every mother’s son of you, if you don’t leave ’em
alone.’”</p>

<p>“That ain’t so,” said Joe. “That man was jest a liar.
Cigarettes never killed Pecos Bill. He was, however,
a great smoker, but he never smoked Bull Durham.
He made him up a mixture of his own, the principal
ingredients bein’ Kentucky home-spun, sulphur, and
gun-powder. Why, he would have thought he was a
sissy if he’d smoked Bull Durham.</p>

<p>“When the matches was scerce Bill used to ride out
into a thunderstorm and light his cigarette with a
streak of lightnin’, and that’s no doubt what’s back of
a tale you hear every once in a while about him bein’
struck and kilt. But nobody that knows how Bill
throwed a surcingle over a streak of lightnin’ and rode
it over Pike’s Peak will ever believe that story.”</p>

<p>“I heard it was liquor that killed pore Bill,” said
Hank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“Must of been boot-leg,” said Red.</p>

<p>“Naw,” said Hank. “You see, Bill bein’ brought up
as he was from tender youth on whiskey and onions,
was still a young man when whiskey lost its kick for
him. He got to puttin’ nitroglycerin in his drinks. That
worked all right for a while, but soon he had to go to
wolf-bait; and when that got so it didn’t work, he
went to fish-hooks. Bill used to say, rather sorrowful-like,
that that was the only way he could git an idear
from his booze. But after about fifty years the fish-hooks
rusted out his interior parts and brought pore
Bill to an early grave.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know who told you that windy,” said Joe.
“It might of been your own daddy. But it ain’t so. It’s
jest another damn lie concocted by them damn prohibition
men.”</p>

<p>“I heard another tale,” said Red, “which may be
right for all I know. I heard that Bill went to Fort
Worth one time, and there he seen a Boston man who
had jist come to Texas with a mail-order cowboy outfit
on; and when Bill seen him, he jist naturally laid down
and laughed his self to death.”</p>

<p>“That may be so,” said Joe, “but I doubt it. I heard
one tale about the death of Pecos Bill that I believe is
the real correct and true account.”</p>

<p>“And what was that?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“Well, Bill happened to drift into Cheyenne jest as
the first rodeo was bein’ put on. Bein’ a bit curious to
know what it was all about, he went out to the grounds
to look the thing over. When he seen the ropers and
the riders, he begun to weep; the first tears he’d shed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
since the death of Slue-Foot Sue. Well, finally when
a country lawyer jest three years out of Mississippi got
up to make a speech and referred to the men on horseback
as cowboys, Bill turned white and begun to
tremble. And then when the country lawyer went on to
talk about ‘keepin’ inviolate the sacred traditions of the
Old West,’ Bill jest went out and crawled in a prairie-dog
hole and died of solemncholy.”</p>

<p>Lanky looked at Red and Hank. They had not
missed the point, but they chose to ignore it.</p>

<p>Joe talked on. “After several years,” he said, “when
all Bill’s would-be rivals was sure he was dead, they
all begun to try to ruin his reputation and defame his
character. They said he was a hot-headed, overbearin’
sort of feller. They was too scered to use the word,
even after Bill died, but what they meant was that
he was a <i>killer</i>.</p>

<p>“Now, Pecos Bill did kill lots of men. He never kept
no tally his self, and I don’t suppose nobody will ever
know jest how many he took off. Of course I’m not
referrin’ to Mex’cans and Indians. Bill didn’t count
them. But Bill wasn’t a bad man, and he hardly ever
killed a man without just cause.</p>

<p>“For instance, there was Big Ike that he shot for
snorin’, that Bill’s enemies talked up so much. But
them that was doin’ the talkin’ would forgit to mention
that Bill had been standin’ guard over Mexico steers
every night for six weeks and was gittin’ a bit sleepy.</p>

<p>“Then there was Ris Risbone. Ris was one of these
practical jokers, and he ramrodded an outfit that fell
in behind Bill’s on the trail. Ris had a dozen or so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
jokes, and when he pulled one, he slapped his knees
and laughed and laughed whether anybody else was
a-laughin’ or not. One day Ris rode up to Bill’s chuck-wagon
when there wasn’t nobody there but the cook,
and he was asleep in the shade of the wagon with his
head between the wheels. Ris slipped up and grabbed
the trace chains and begun rattlin’ ’em and yellin’
‘Whoa! Whoa!’ The pore spick woke up thinkin’ that
the team was runnin’ away, and that he was about to
git his pass to Saint Peter. He jumped up and bumped
his head on the wagon; then he wakes up and looks
around, and there stands Ris slappin’ his knees and
laughin’. Jest then Bill rides up, but he never said
nothin’.</p>

<p>“When the outfits got to Abilene, Bill was in the
White Elephant with some of his men, fixin’ to take
a drink. Jest as Bill was about to drop his fish-hooks
in his glass, Ris poked his head in at the winder and
yelled, ‘Fire! Fire!’—and Bill did.</p>

<p>“In one killin’, however, Bill acted a bit hasty, as he
admitted his self. One day he called Three-Fingered
Ed out of the saloon, sayin’ he’d like to speak with
him in private. Bill led Ed out into a back alley, and
there they stopped.</p>

<p>“‘Say, Ed,’ he says, lookin’ him right in the eye,
‘didn’t you say that Mike said I was a hot-headed, overbearin’
sort of feller?’</p>

<p>“‘Naw,’ says Ed, ‘You mistook me. He never said
that.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, doggone,’ says Bill, ‘ain’t that too bad. I’ve
gone and killed an innocent man.’</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition

approach us with offers to donate.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
